# INFO Distracting Trivia

Observation - I have a constant urge to look up obscure facts, e.g.
"tunes in common meter in a minor key". But I really don't need to
know. Looking these up is mostly passive, and provides a sort of dopamine
hit. Not knowing makes me find other ways to get the answer like "look
at common meter tunes in a songbook that I know tends to have more
minor keys than others" &#x2026; I have to be active to find the answer,
maybe I won't find an answer, maybe it didn't matter in the first place,
I have to make a judgment about the value and utility of the information.
My mind is engaged in the whole process, whether or not I find an
answer.   I think keeping my mind active rather than passive is my
real goal.

# TODO Replace Google Authenticator

State Tax site wants to text or use google auth.
I thought I set up passkey, but it's not taking it.
Have to turn on the phone

# TODO Make passkey work

# TODO Remaining reachable

-   reason: away from home for 8 hours.  Medical issues.  Can't be
    unreachable.
    -   Possible solutions
        -   Do nothing.  Just leave it off.   Remain unreachable.
        -   Don't go anywhere.
        -   Check in at intervals (phone on) then turn it off.
        -   Give contact # of someone I'll be with
        -   Get a pager

# TODO Podcasts and Audible

-   **Audible:** I binge-listened to 5 hours of "The History of Rome"
    podcast on Audible.
    -   **Alternative:** Don't listen to Podcasts and Audible.
    -   **Alternative:** Download podcasts to an MP3 player/bluetooth
        device.
        -   side effect - this makes the decision of what to spend time
            listening to much more intentional.

# TODO Find alternative to Google Maps, Waze (paper maps, planning)

-   **Google Maps:** I used google maps to figure out if there was a
    better way around a traffic backup.
    -   **Alternative:** Use physical maps, pick routes less likely to
        have backups.

# INFO Distracted Parking

-   Mental observations of having the phone on
    -   **distracted parking:** While trying to navigate round traffic jams I pulled
        over several times to check Google Maps.  One time I stopped in
        gas station parking lot and did not realize I was blocking the
        entrance and got honked at.  Stress.  Thanks, smart phone


<a id="org31ab40d"></a>

# INFO Distracted Driving

-   **Fiddling with the phone:** I fiddled with the phone more than I
    should have while driving.   Bad.  Advertising by the road is
    designed to take the drivers attention off the road.  Bad.

# INFO Distracting Newsfeeds

-   Note taken on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-10-05 Sat 08:46] </span></span>   
    -   I'm not reading news web sites
        -   answer: back to rss, elfeed
    -   I'm not listening to podcats
        -   is that a loss?
    -   I have to spend more time at my computer
        -   but that was my working life for 38+ years

    9/24/24 or so - resurrected my Google Voice (new number :-().  Can use
    it for calls, text.   Learned to forward phone there.
    Tested.  May port my number there so that I can text from computer.
