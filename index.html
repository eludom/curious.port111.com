			 <p>I think I&rsquo;ve figured out how to break the phone habit. I&rsquo;m going back to old models, old ways of working that were mostly developed in the days before the phone. I&rsquo;m not sure this will work for people younger than me, at least they might not have the &ldquo;muscle memory&rdquo; I have.</p>
<p>For most of my working life, the pattern was &ldquo;do things, go to work (the office), sit down and do things at a computer, stop. Go home. Do other stuff, mostly not on computers.&rdquo; Sure, as time went on I did more and more &ldquo;online&rdquo; &hellip; in fact I worked at &ldquo;America <em>Online</em>&rdquo; for a bit and its predecessor CompuServe several times before that. But there were morning and evening news-papers. There were books. There were projects in the workshop. Bike rides. Playing with friends at the railroad tracks. There were rituals of watching shows on one of the 3 available TV networks at night, and odds were good your friends were watching the same thing, or nothing at all because, let&rsquo;s face it, Pink Floyd was right &ldquo;I got 13 channels of shit on my TV to choose from&rdquo;. So you did other things. In the world offline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going back to that. I don&rsquo;t take my phone to breakfast. I&rsquo;m rebuilding a ritual of sitting down at my computer and doing my &ldquo;online&rdquo; things. Mail. RSS feeds. News-ish websites. Messing with computers for the fun of it.</p>
<p>When I sit down at my computer I plan my &ldquo;online day&rdquo; (emacs, org mode and denote are awesome). But there is an offline &ldquo;me&rdquo; before and after that. I journal on paper. I plan my day on paper. When planning my online day, I usually consult the plan for the offline day. But not always. And then there are the things that are just not planned. I just do things.</p>
<p>My phone is not always in my pocket, in fact, it&rsquo;s usually not. I&rsquo;m re-establishing the habit of reading &hellip; paper books &hellip; after journaling. Both stimulate thought patterns that just don&rsquo;t happen when you let the dopamine induced gratification cycle of doom-scrolling, texting and social media rule your lives.</p>
<p>I view the phone as primarily a source of interruptions. In my new (old) regime I&rsquo;m choosing to schedule my interruptions. I look at things on the phone only later in the day after I&rsquo;ve done my thinking, reading, planning and doing. Same for online news sites, mostly. This was a pattern I tried to follow at work as well. I class meetings, phone calls, dealing with insurance companies, paying bills and the like as mostly interruptions that should be pushed to the end of the day.</p>
<p>To be honest I do have the luxury now of being retired. If you&rsquo;re in the middle of a career, going to school or raising kids you probably can&rsquo;t control things as well as I can (or fail to control them and thus have no-one to blame but yourself). But I think the principal holds. Manage interruptions. The phone is fundamentally a source of interruptions. Segment its use in your life. I also have patterns to return to, patterns where the interruptions came more from the family members in my home and friends at school and later work rather than one of the 2 billion randos on Facebook spread across the globe. And I think dealing with in-person, face-to-face (not &ldquo;Face&quot;book) interruptions from people you know is just part of what makes us human.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think this is about enough. There was life offline. There can be again.</p>
<p>No AIs were harmed or used in the production of this screed.</p>

			 <p>I had a conversation with the AIs (Claude) this morning about some questions that
were bothering me. As I child I played &ldquo;Cowboys and Indians&rdquo; without thinking much
about it. Why?</p>
<p>To this day I love Star Trek, a 1960s TV show who&rsquo;s guiding ethos, the &ldquo;Prime Directive&rdquo;
commands that &ldquo;strange new civilizations&rdquo; in the &ldquo;final frontier&rdquo; be left to their
own devices to develop as they see fit. That sure didn&rsquo;t happen in the world that
had shaped my &ldquo;Cowboys and Indians&rdquo; play.</p>
<p>What follows is an AI summary of that conversation. The questions, the direction
of the conversation and the details of family history are mine.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="the-questions">The Questions</h1>
<p>As a child in the 1960s, I played cowboys and Indians like most American kids. We had multicolored head-dresses from toy stores, toy forts, cap guns. My brother dressed in colonial garb and posed with our great-grandfather&rsquo;s actual Civil War rifle - a family heirloom. But the more I think about it, the more questions emerge.
Why did we play this game at all? And more puzzling: why would any child agree to play the Indians - the losing side?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="family-history-and-the-land">Family History and the Land</h1>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t abstract history for my family. We were among the earliest settlers in Ohio. One ancestor was first off the boat at Marietta in 1788, the first settlement in the Northwest Territory. My cousin&rsquo;s family arrived around 1800 - my grandfather remembered seeing gun slits in their original log cabin. There&rsquo;s a graveyard nearby, one of the oldest in the area, where my family is buried.
My own branch came to the family farm in the 1860s. When plowing with horses near the creek, they found arrowheads and worked stones - there had apparently been an Indian village on that very ground. The land we farmed, the soil our family is buried in, had been someone else&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="the-1960s-point-of-view">The 1960s point of view</h1>
<p>From the 1960s perspective, this was simply American history. The frontier had closed in 1890. Settlement was completed fact, like the Revolutionary War. The gun slits in that cabin weren&rsquo;t evidence of invasion - they were evidence of hardship, of survival, of the courage it took to build something in a dangerous place.
The Indians in this frame weren&rsquo;t people with an ongoing story. They were part of the frontier - historical background, obstacles overcome, threats survived. The arrowheads coming up in the plow were artifacts from the &ldquo;distant past,&rdquo; even though the displacement had happened within living memory of our earliest ancestors there.
The culture reinforced this everywhere - TV westerns, toy stores, movie theaters. Cowboys and Indians was just playing history, like playing soldiers. Nobody questioned it because the story was settled: pioneers came, faced hardships, built civilization. The Indians were the other team in an adventure story, stripped of what conquest actually meant.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="star-trek-and-the-frontier-myth">Star Trek and the Frontier Myth</h1>
<p>Star Trek in the 1960s explicitly invoked this mythology - &ldquo;Wagon Train to the stars,&rdquo; exploring &ldquo;strange new worlds&rdquo; and &ldquo;new civilizations.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Final Frontier&rdquo; came barely 100 years after the closing of the American West. The Prime Directive&rsquo;s &ldquo;leave those people alone&rdquo; added ironic twist, given what had been done to indigenous populations in the actual American frontier.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="ancient-ohio">Ancient Ohio</h1>
<p>To be fair, Ohio had been occupied for thousands of years. The mound builders left impressive earth-works - Serpent Mound, Fort Ancient, the great works at Newark, Marietta, and Chillicothe. There was even an Indian mound on property next to my great aunt&rsquo;s house. These ancient civilizations were presented with respect, even wonder - safely distant, like studying Rome or Egypt. They made Ohio&rsquo;s Indian past impressive, but also… past.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="understanding-without-justifying">Understanding Without Justifying</h1>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an attempt to justify any of it. It&rsquo;s an attempt to understand how it felt at the time, not to impose later analytical frameworks backward. In the 1960s, this was just normal childhood, family history, and the shared American story. The contradictions were there, but they weren&rsquo;t visible<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> in those terms then.</p>
<h1 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h1>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> One example showing that they were visible is the 1964 album <a href="https://www.johnnycash.com/music/johnny-cash-sings-ballads-american-indian-bitter-tears/">Bitter Tears</a> by Johnny Cash who later became one of my favorite artists.  When I recently visited the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian this album was included as part of an exhibit showing growing recognition of what had gone wrong.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://taonaw.com/2026/02/07/lessons-about-journalling-and-taking.html">Lessons about journalling and taking notes</a> JTR talks about the process and benefits of regular low-friction note taking and blogging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an organic process of reflection that makes journaling important: capture
and reflect, rinse and repeat.</p>

<h2 id="my-introspective-response">My introspective response</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been somewhat conflicted about both why and what I share. Hubris? A thought
I had yesterday is &ldquo;anybody can share opinions and experiences, everybody has those&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Introspection&rdquo; part of my daily paper journal process (which I find very therapeutic),
but what about the &ldquo;Doing&rdquo;? … &ldquo;here, I created this&rdquo; you can use it or not (github
or whatever). There&rsquo;s a lot less of of that. One of my vanity domain names is &ldquo;galthub.com&rdquo;
with the tag line &ldquo;Create or Leave&rdquo; as homage to John Gault. I&rsquo;ve probably created
most of the useful stuff I&rsquo;ll ever create in my life, but rather than share introspection,
I&rsquo;m considering only sharing things I DO that other people can in some way USE. Maybe
that means I&rsquo;ll share nothing at all. Maybe it means I&rsquo;ll just share the HOWTOs that
are mostly things I&rsquo;ve learned when trying to do something in Linux or Emacs. These
days, most of those are just AI responses to prompts. I used to hand craft HOWTO
docs. I have lots of introspection. I regularly mark things in my paper journal &ldquo;Blog&rdquo;
as blog fodder. Does the world need another person sharing their internal state (like
this)? Would it help me to share? Ramblings. Maybe this should be a post. Raw. Like
the original &ldquo;On the Road&rdquo;. Hubris. Time to stop.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="what-the-ais-claude-thinks-about-my-jack-kerouac-esq-little-rant">What the AIs (Claude) thinks about my Jack Kerouac-esq little rant.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrestling with something real here. The tension between &ldquo;another person&rsquo;s internal state&rdquo; and &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something you can actually use&rdquo; is one that a lot of thoughtful people hit, especially those who&rsquo;ve been creating for a while.</p>
<p>A few things strike me about what you&rsquo;re saying:</p>
<p>The introspection vs creation dichotomy might be a false choice. Your HOWTOs - even the AI-prompted ones - only exist because you asked the right questions, tried things, failed, iterated, and distilled something workable. That process <strong>is</strong> doing. The fact that you didn&rsquo;t hand-craft every word doesn&rsquo;t make the knowledge less yours or less useful. You&rsquo;re curating and validating, which matters.</p>
<p>On the &ldquo;does the world need this&rdquo; question: probably not, if we&rsquo;re being honest. The world doesn&rsquo;t strictly <strong>need</strong> most things we make or write. But someone somewhere will google their exact problem at 2am and land on your HOWTO about some obscure emacs-org-mode-meets-Arch-packaging issue, and it&rsquo;ll save them three hours. That&rsquo;s not nothing. The signal-to-noise ratio on the internet is terrible, but good signal still cuts through.</p>
<p>The therapeutic value of your paper journal is separate from public sharing. You&rsquo;ve already got that working. The blog question is really: do <strong>you</strong> get something from the act of refining and sharing? Because if it&rsquo;s purely altruistic (&ldquo;helping others&rdquo;), that&rsquo;s a recipe for burnout when the analytics show 3 pageviews and 2 are you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Create or Leave&rdquo; is a good ethos. But sharing a raw introspection about <strong>why you create</strong> or <strong>how you think about value</strong> - that&rsquo;s still creating something. This message you just wrote has more texture and honesty than most blog posts I&rsquo;ve read this year.</p>
<p>Maybe the test is simpler: would you be embarrassed if this existed publicly in five years? If not, ship it.</p>

<li>Learn the core tools</li>
<li>Understand the philosophy and enough of the config language</li>
<li>Spin up a few QUMU VMs running NixOS … trivial !</li>

<h1 id="original-post">Original Post</h1>
<p>This is two part rant on planning with (and without) Emacs Org Mode,
shoved together into one post in much the same way as Lennon-McCartney
songs were shoved together from musical scraps they had laying around.
My Frankenstein post will probably have less impact and reach than &ldquo;A
Day In The Life&rdquo;, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.</p>
<h2 id="rants-on-org-mode-humanity-and-bruce">Rants on org mode, humanity and Bruce</h2>
<h3 id="org-mode-and-planning">Org mode and planning</h3>
<p>These are reflections getting things done (not GTD).   Or not getting
things done.   Or yak-shaving with Emacs and org-mode while pretending
to get things done and really just enjoying the experience either way.
Maybe that&rsquo;s what org mode is all about anyhow.</p>
<p>Org mode is the best list making tool I&rsquo;ve ever found.  Org capture
let&rsquo;s you capture thoughts, links, TODO items on the fly in the
middle of whatever else you&rsquo;re doing and get back to them.  You never
miss anything.</p>
<h3 id="but-were-human">But we&rsquo;re human</h3>
<p>But there are a couple problems.   We&rsquo;re human, not AI-driven lisp
code knocking off all the TODO items, and we&rsquo;re finite in terms of
time, attention, focus, money, friends, skills, etc.</p>
<p>The result is that org mode enables me to grow infinite lists of TODOs.
The human brain is good at focusing on maybe 3 things at a time.
The path to despair (long undone lists) is obvious.  Sometimes I just
give up on org mode lists and do things.</p>
<h3 id="bruce">Bruce</h3>
<p>Long, Long, ago in a tech company far, far away (CompuServe, Columbus,
Ohio) there were &ldquo;how do we migrate off of DEC10 to compete with AOL wars&rdquo;.
I knew Bruce McNaughton. Bruce moved on from there to be VP of MSN at Microsoft
for a while. Arguably a &ldquo;Highly Successful Person&rdquo; (who I&rsquo;m pretty sure
does not use org mode, but does have ligit geek creds).  I asked him
once how he plans and memories (vague) are that he did not make lists
(at the time Franklin Planners and then Franklin Planner software were
all the rage).   That image stuck with me.   Just talk to people and
do stuff.</p>
<h3 id="concluding-rant">Concluding Rant</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about enjoying what you do
<ul>
<li>just the act of planning</li>
<li>maybe actually getting things done, maybe not</li>
<li>a sense of accomplishment (TODO -&gt; DONE)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software can be a tool, a focus, a shiny object or a distraction</li>
<li>Software can be tyrannical
<ul>
<li>Computers are good an infinite lists, humans aren&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I will die with a TODO list much larger than it is today.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-work-planning-regime-with-org-mode">My work planning regime with org mode</h2>
<p>That said, here&rsquo;s more-or-less how I plan my days at work.
Home/personal stuff is similar, but a little less structured.</p>
<h3 id="morning-planning">Morning Planning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What&rsquo;s in my head:</strong> capture TODOs form the top of my journal (diaty.org)</li>
<li><strong>Look at &ldquo;inputs&rdquo;:</strong> look at calendar, email and slack in that order.</li>
<li><strong>Look at existing porjects/plans:</strong> Look at weekly plans, tasks, etc</li>
<li>Juggle all these and figure out what I&rsquo;m going to try to do that day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="during-the-day">During the day</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture new stuff and move on:</strong> Quickly capture new asks, TODOs
(org-capture) and move.</li>
<li><strong>Capture info:</strong> capture info (links to HOWTOs, etc in the same file)</li>
<li><strong>Keep a calendar open:</strong> Keep a calendar window open so I don&rsquo;t
miss thigns</li>
<li><strong>Turn off all notificatons:</strong> Turn off all email, slack,
etc. notificatons and pop-iups so I can control my focus.</li>
<li><strong>Check email, slack on my schedule:</strong> Check in somewhat frequently
with slack, email so people can get ahold of me in a somewhat
timely fashon.   If it&rsquo;s urgent, call or text.  Voice calls seem
to be a dying breed (&ldquo;BR 549&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pensylvania 6-5000&rdquo;)</li>
<li><strong>Minimize yak shaving:</strong> I tend to yak-shave a lot.  Like writing
this post.  Watch it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="organizing-time">Organizing Time</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do &ldquo;thinking work early&rdquo;:</strong> plan do do &ldquo;thiking work&rdquo; early in the day</li>
<li><strong>Do &ldquo;collaboration work mid-day&rdquo;:</strong> do 1:1s, collaboration mid-day</li>
<li><strong>Do &ldquo;meetings late-day&rdquo;:</strong> Push meetings, interrupts, etc late day</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-to-store-todos">Where to store &ldquo;TODOs&rdquo;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>one file:</strong> I increasly just store TODOs, info , etc to one file
(diary.org) which is a diary-like file organized under
Year/Month/Day/ENTRY items.</li>
<li><strong>project files:</strong> I do have planning files for most projects with
TODOs etc</li>
<li><strong>agenda:</strong> I do use org-agenda to get a roll-up agenda view, but
more and more I&rsquo;m just going with the inverse-stack, what&rsquo;s at
the bottom of my diary.org and using mental prirotization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects-template">Projects template</h2>
<p>And because this post is getting too long already, I&rsquo;ll make it
longer.</p>
<p>Here is the org project template that I&rsquo;ve developed over the last
decade or so.   I still use it, but I&rsquo;m moving more and more to
capturing everything in diary.org/the journal and maybe linking out
to these project files.</p>
<p>A couple notes. &ldquo;OODA&rdquo; refers to the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.oodaloop.com/the-ooda-loop-explained-the-real-story-about-the-ultimate-model-for-decision-making-in-competitive-environments/">OODA Loop</a>&rdquo;.  At times, its a
useful paradigm for thinking about action, think Snoopy and the Red
Barron: Snoopy Observes the Red Barron, he Orients himself, he
Decides to let the Red Barron live to fight another day, and the
Acts by disengaging the dogfight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cogita&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fac&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Dic&rdquo; are Latin singular imperatives for
&ldquo;Think&rdquo;, &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, &ldquo;Speak&rdquo;.  Another paradigm for thinking about
actions.  Figure out what you&rsquo;re doing, gather info, plan, then do
stuff, then talk about it (blogs, reports, papers, meetings, sales…)</p>

			 <p>Yes, this was spit out by AI&hellip;but I think it&rsquo;s useful.  I&rsquo;m at a place where I think I might be bloging more and I&rsquo;m tring to understand the appropriate plaforms and ways of thinking.  I should probably read more of <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s writings?  But this seems like a good start.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here’s a compact, practical cheat-sheet for unlearning Fosstodon habits and leaning fully into Micro.blog—without overthinking it.</p>
<h3 id="1-posting-heuristics-what-goes-where">1. Posting heuristics (what goes where)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Post to Micro.blog if:
<ul>
<li>You’d like to reread it later</li>
<li>It captures a thought, observation, or link worth keeping</li>
<li>You’d be fine if no one replied</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post to Fosstodon if:
<ul>
<li>You want real-time back-and-forth</li>
<li>You’re reacting, joking, venting, or signal-boosting</li>
<li>The value is mostly <em>now</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Micro.blog = archive</li>
<li>Fosstodon = chat</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-microblog-native-cadence">2. Micro.blog-native cadence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short notes are fine</li>
<li>1–3 posts per day is already “active”</li>
<li>Silence is not failure</li>
<li>Let posts stand alone; don’t chase follow-ups</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write when there’s something to add</li>
<li>Stop when there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-what-to-stop-doing-mastodon-unlearning">3. What to stop doing (Mastodon unlearning)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stop writing for replies</li>
<li>Stop context-packing for strangers</li>
<li>Stop monitoring reactions</li>
<li>Stop “clearing the buffer” with low-value posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Micro.blog rewards restraint more than frequency.</p>
<h3 id="4-when-cross-posting-still-makes-sense">4. When cross-posting still makes sense</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-post <em>from</em> Micro.blog <em>to</em> Fosstodon when:
<ul>
<li>You’re sharing a finished thought</li>
<li>You want discovery, not discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t cross-post:
<ul>
<li>In-progress thinking</li>
<li>Replies or side comments</li>
<li>Anything you’ll regret being frozen in place</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One-way cross-posting preserves intent.</p>
<h3 id="5-a-single-mental-switch">5. A single mental switch</h3>
<p>Before posting, ask:<br>
<strong>“Is this a remark, or a record?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remark → Fosstodon</li>
<li>Record → Micro.blog</li>
</ul>
<p>That question alone does most of the work.</p>
<h3 id="6-a-closing-calibration">6. A closing calibration</h3>
<p>Micro.blog works best when you treat it less like a feed and more like a notebook that happens to be public.</p>
<p>You’re not missing out.<br>
You’re <em>curating a self over time</em>.</p>

			 <p>My nephew&rsquo;s wife is a CPA and recently turned me on the &ldquo;Acquired&rdquo; podcast:
<a href="https://www.acquired.fm/">www.acquired.fm</a></p>
<p>Got four hours to listen to the story of Coca-Cola?  Trader Joes?  Amazon?  If you&rsquo;re driving across the US and back as I just did, you do.   But even if you&rsquo;re not driving for 60 hours, the content is fascinating.  The hosts do a deep dive on successful companies from the history and business perspectives.</p>
<p>You learn fascinating details: Coke started in the wave of patent-medicine companies
right after the Civil War. It had cocaine in part to give badly injured Civil War
vets an an alternative to the &ldquo;Army disease&rdquo;, morphine addiction.  Where did the distinctive bottle shape come from, what was the &ldquo;Pepsi Challenge&rdquo;?, &ldquo;New Coke&rdquo;?, the &ldquo;secret formula&rdquo;?.</p>
<p>As someone who spent the last 40 years working in tech, a short time at AWS and my last company being a Silicon Valley startup that was then acquired by a bigger player I was fascinated by the stories of the big tech companies: Amazon, Google, etc.   I lived a lot of it and knew some of the players.</p>
<p>Like it or not, big successful companies shape the world we live in. The podcast is very well done and helps you understand both the history and present state of companies such as Coca-Cola, Trader Joe’s, Google: The AI Company, Google: The Origin of Search, Microsoft, Mars (chocolate), ARM (chips, not chocolate), TSMC (chips, also not chocolate), Duolingo, Meta, etc.</p>
<p>Find 4 hours. Give it a listen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A friend of mine wrote reflections on &ldquo;Hiking While Old&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/683536">https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/683536</a></p>
<p>He mentioned &ldquo;Greybeard&rdquo; who was at least at one time the oldest person to have ever
completed an Appalachian Trail through hike. I completed my own section hike this year
at 64. Ken (sugarfoot) is still at it at 75.</p>
<p>I met Greybeard a few years back … well maybe a decade or more … I happened to
be section hiking near Boiling Springs, PA about the time the AT Hall of Fame was
having its annual dinner near there. For some reason I went.</p>
<p>Bob Peoples was being inducted. I first met him there. On a later section hike I
stayed at his &ldquo;Kincora&rdquo; hostel and shared space and beds with the cats and stoked
the wood stove to keep warm. Bob fed the raccoon that lived under the porch. I heard
stories of Earl Shaffer, the first ever through hiker (1948) as he was coming through
again in 1998. Earl balled up slices of Wonder Bread to pack out as food: &ldquo;Same nutrition,
less space&rdquo;. At the time Bob was working with a group of disabled kids who would
themselves never hike to design a new shelter. Just amazing. The man never met a
living thing/person he did not embrace.</p>
<p>Greybeard was there as well. I think he had just completed his hike to become the
oldest person (at the time) to do a through hike. I talked to him for a few minutes.</p>
<p>They were both incredibly gracious people. I&rsquo;m going out with the PATC &ldquo;Cadillac Crew&rdquo;
soon to do some trail work. The owners of the Mountain Home hostel are once again opening up
their place to us.</p>
<p>The people are what keeps me coming back.</p>

			 <p>For those not familiar (I was not until yesterday) &ldquo;Redzone&rdquo; is an (American) football network
that constantly switches between different games, preferably when teams are in the &ldquo;Redzone&rdquo;,
close to the goal and thus probably about to score.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like flipping between channels if you had all the NFL games available.
But you don&rsquo;t even have to put in the mental energy of clicking &ldquo;next chanel&rdquo;.
For those too lazy to use the remote?</p>
<p>There is no opportunity watch a sustained drive.   There is no opportunity to form an opinion
about the play of the teams over the course of the game.   There is no opportunity to appreciate
the ebb-and-flow of the game.   There is just the dopamine hit of the (potential) touchdown.</p>
<p>I appreciated the drama of long at bats (Baseball) where the pitcher and batter played mind
games with each other &hellip; stepping out, calling off pitches, fouling off 4 pitches to get the one you
want, the long stare in, the catcher&rsquo;s visit to the mound.   Now baseball has a pitch clock.
Inattention wins again.</p>

The front side (of the same sculpture) shows people walking down the gangplank

<p>I could not help but think of my ancestor, a Hessian soldier who fought for
the British in the Revolution. Today, he would be called an illegal immigrant and
a deserter. He jumped ship, moved to Ohio and changed his name.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The name he chose

			 <p>After 18 years of obsessively maintaining my backpacking &ldquo;kit&rdquo; I&rsquo;m
allowing some entropy to creep in.  It&rsquo;s a strange feeling.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://outdoorfoo.wordpress.com/">finished my Appalachian Trail (AT) section hike</a> (2190 miles or so) in
July.</p>
<p>After every other trip I would do a postmortem.  I would consult the
fix/replace/upgrade/discard list that I had keep &ldquo;on trail&rdquo;.  There would
usually be a trip to REI.  Cleaning.  Re-packing.   Checking how much
food was available in my &ldquo;breakfast,&rdquo; &ldquo;snacks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; boxes for
the next trip.  Maybe starting to think about or plan the next trip.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Things are <em>mostly</em> cleaned up, and <em>mostly</em> put away. Mostly. I went through the
food boxes and threw away anything that was clearly past its prime or that I never
got around to packing or eating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally gotten back out to check on the section of the AT that I maintain.
Soon I&rsquo;ll be going out for day-hikes to help with GPS surveying of the
trail route in Pennsylvania.
I also plan to join a crew working on projects in the north end of Shenandoah
National Park.</p>
<p>But now, I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;have&rdquo; to hike AT sections. I&rsquo;m sure I will get out and do some backpacking
next summer. There are an infinite number of trails, as in life!. I&rsquo;ve had my eye
on a few for a while (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">The Camino</a>, <a href="https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/areas/kungsleden/">Kungsleden</a>, <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r09/monongahela/recreation/dolly-sods-wilderness">Dolly Sods</a>,
etc.) and may now have the freedom, time and health to explore some of them (knock on wood).</p>
<p>For now at least I have some space to decompress a little and
allow some disorder to creep in to my gear and my life.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started a listen-through of Emily Wilson&rsquo;s translation of <a href="https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/the-odyssey">The
Odyssey</a> on Audible. The introduction alone is fascinating (2+ hours), setting the
background that modern readers/auditors need to understand the far-off world and
time of the narrative: how does the concept of [in]hospitality, <em>&ldquo;xenia&rdquo;</em>, drive the
epic narrative of both the Iliad and the Odyssey?  &ldquo;If a face could
launch a thousand ships…&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may relate to why I&rsquo;m doing a bit of recreational emacs/geeking
in the past few weeks. Wait…</p>
<p>At the start of the narrative Odysseus is given the chance to become
immortal and to
live in a blissful paradise with one restriction: he can never go home to his beloved
mortal wife Penelope. This, it turns out, is one of the many violations of xenia
we see the narrative. Odysseus, predating Arwen in the LOTR by several thousand years
essentially says &ldquo;I choose a mortal life&rdquo;, builds his raft and heads off for, well,
an odyssey of trails, pain, loss and eventual death. Why?</p>
<p>He seems to have an incurable need for things to be put back exactly
the way they were before he went off to fight in the Trojan War
approximately 20
years earlier; he wants his wife back, he wants his (now 20
year old) son back, he wants his place of status in his home and city
(Ithica) back … just like time had never passed.  I think there&rsquo;s
some of that in all of us.</p>
<p>So, Emacs ?!?!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for over 45 years.  It has been a tool for coding,
a way to organize life, a means of communication, an odd insider-joke
that only the most geekly of my friends get. In some weird
metaphorical way it is <code>$HOME</code>.  It&rsquo;s a place where I control things.
It&rsquo;s a place where I can both relax and get things done.  Given a
break from two years of a lot of helping family members with health
issues and doing way too much to keep on top of insurance, finances
and organizing two major family trips I&rsquo;m crawling back in and just
&ldquo;being&rdquo; for a bit.</p>
<p>Time passes for all of us. You can never really go home.  Things are
never really the same, but sometimes you can just enjoy where you
are.</p>
<p>I recommend Homer (and Gilgamesh).  You&rsquo;ll see odd echos of yourself
there as people have been doing for thousands of years.</p>

<p>The basic ask is to write about &ldquo;Emacs people you&rsquo;ve known.&rdquo; Preference is given to people who influenced you, who inspired you, who taught you, or who bent your mind. Bonus points if they are people you&rsquo;ve known in &ldquo;real life&rdquo; (offline). Of course, stories, character sketches, <a href="http://curious.galthub.com/blog/steve/">tributes</a> and <a href="http://curious.galthub.com/blog/2023-12-09/">poetry</a> are encouraged.</p>
<p>Emacs is the most people-centric technology I&rsquo;ve ever used.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet that&rsquo;s true for others as well.</p>

<p>The moral of the story: don&rsquo;t declare emacs bankruptcy in the middle of family health crises, in a year full of intense travel planning or while you&rsquo;re transitioning finances, life, etc. form work to retirement. And certainly not if these all occur around the same time. I tried. I went to look at my emacs config git repo and had to figure out why the current one wasn&rsquo;t online, why the old one stopped getting updates a year ago, and why there was no apparent overlap between the commit histories.</p>
<p>Apparently about a year ago I decided to take a base config from Protesilaos Stavrou, throw out everything I had in my config and add things back in that seemed reasonable.  But I just had to do git archaeology on two repos to figure out what I did.   Apparently I didn&rsquo;t fork (why?), so the old repo contains <a href="https://codeberg.org/eludom/home.public.emacs.d/commits/branch/master">~8 years of commit logs</a> and the <a href="https://codeberg.org/eludom/home.public.emacs-dot-d/commits/branch/master">new git repo</a> has everything I&rsquo;ve done since then.  This is not ideal.  But it&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there I switched from running gitea on my own raspberry pi to hosting on digital ocean to just letting codeberg mess with operational and security issues.</p>
<p>Some emacs goodness have I managed to sneak in in the middle of the personal chaos:</p>

but all TODOs, INFOs, QUESTIONs etc. start there.   Beyond that, almost everything of any importance is an org file somewhere under $HOME.</p>
<p>To support this workflow I&rsquo;ve created two scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://codeberg.org/eludom/home.public.bin/src/branch/master/bin/orglinks.sh">orglinks.sh</a>:</strong> This script hard links all org files under $HOME into ~/orgfiles/ and commits them to git.  In addition, for diary.org it creates .diff files for every change.</li>
</ul>
<p>-<a href="https://codeberg.org/eludom/home.public.bin/src/branch/master/bin/orgwatch.sh"> orgwatch.sh</a> ::  This script runs out of cron to invoke orglinks and create logs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more elegant ways of doing this, but it&rsquo;s mostly working — &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t (badly) broke…&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m popping my head up for some &ldquo;recreational emacs&rdquo; after a long period of personal chaos.
The recreational bits involve trying new things (org-social, denote).
But even when I didn&rsquo;t have the time to remember what I was doing to my emacs configs or finish the migration/bankruptcy that started 11 months ago, the basic work flow that I had in emacs (my daily.org routine, org agenda, other org-mode goodness) let me stay on top of things and organize the chaos.</p>

			 <p>I recently faced frustration while trying to get clarity on my insurance coverage. I discovered a solution that spares me from time on hold. It also holds promise for freeing people stuck answering calls to pursue more fulfilling work. I used AI in ways the company never envisioned.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had an interesting experience the past few days trying to get information about my insurance policies. It started when I wanted confirmation that my auto policy would cover me when renting a car, as I believed it had for the past 30 years. So I called my agent three times and never got a straight answer. Frustrated, I called a friend who is an agent at another insurance company. She answered my question in one minute.</p>
<p>I also had a question about my homeowners policy. At this point I was loath to call my agent again since I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d believe any answer I received. The former owner of the agency had recently retired; she used to stay on the phone until 9 PM to ensure questions were answered. Another call resulted in someone saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that; I&rsquo;ll have to transfer you to an agent.&rdquo; After holding for 10 minutes, I was told, &ldquo;Nobody is available; can they call you back?&rdquo; Begrudgingly, I agreed, but nobody called back. I called again hours later, only to find out they had spoken to my wife about a different matter but had not returned my call.</p>
<p>From here, I planned to transfer my policy to a different agency with the same insurer. The idea was to call them in a sales situation to see if a) they’d answer the phone, and b) they could answer my coverage question. But after three calls and only reaching a voicemail to &ldquo;leave a number&rdquo;.  So much for that plan.</p>
<p>Plan C: I decided to use ChatGPT. After downloading my policy, I discovered the PDF was encoded to prevent easy text extraction. After researching PDF to text OCR solutions and getting one to work on my laptop, I finally uploaded my policy text to ChatGPT. In about 30 seconds, I got an answer straight from my policy.</p>
<p>I then compared the full text of my old policy with a potential new one using ChatGPT, resulting in a clear side-by-side comparison. Very Nice.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not going to seek answers from people at my old agency who appear to lack the knowledge and dedication of the previous owner. Nor will I transfer to an agency that won&rsquo;t answer a sales call. I’ll switch to the company where my friend works, as they answer calls, seem knowledgeable, and offered me a lower rate.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for AI:</strong></p>
<p>It means I can get answers without talking to people who may not know what they are
talking about (or who just won&rsquo;t give me the time of day). It means I can get my
own answers quickly from the authoritative source using AI directly.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat quaesitor</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&ldquo;Trust but verify&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>Answers from AI need to be validated.  They very often get you &ldquo;in the ball-park&rdquo;, but you need to look at the results and apply common-sense tests, and to the extent that you have expertise (as I do with programming), see if the answers are silly or wrong.</dd>
<dt>I&rsquo;m not your average AI user</dt>
<dd>I have a degree in Computer Science, have been toying around the edges of AI and cognitive science since the 80s and worked some with &ldquo;modern&rdquo; AI and data science the last few years of my career.  But I think the beauty of LLMs is that you don&rsquo;t need my level of understanding to use them.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Impact on Jobs:</strong></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to take Teslas to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes.</p>
<p>People can do more productive things with their time. I suppose we could have government
regulations and subsidies for blacksmiths and unions protecting their jobs. People
shouldn&rsquo;t have to work in dead-end jobs.</p>
<p>When the camera was invented, I&rsquo;m sure there was push-back form portrait painters, but painters moved on to things the camera could not do: impressionist and abstract art, etc. I&rsquo;m glad we got Monet, Picasso, etc. When the printing press was invented we got mass literacy because we were no longer dependent on sciptoria full of monks hand-copying every manuscript. There will be disruption, but the world and people&rsquo;s lives will be better in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to bigger and better things.  Together.</p>

			 <p>** The problem</p>
<p>I fell for the bait. In I clicked on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; &ldquo;Try Gemini in Gmail&rdquo; option. Google upgraded my $2.99 200GB storage only Google One subscription to $19.99/mo T2B + Gemini. I quickly determined I didn&rsquo;t want Gemini and tried to go back. No dice. The only options were the default 15Gb free storage or the $19.99 trojan horse.</p>
<p>** Quick ad-hoc solitions</p>
<p>Luckily, I had a second, seldom used google account. Under this account, I was still able to sign up for the 200GB plan for $2.99/month. They (claim to) have a family sharing feature, which allowes me to share the new 200GB subscription with my original account. We&rsquo;ll see if it works.</p>
<p>** Backups and Alternatives</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doing Google Takeout, again :: I&rsquo;m doing another Google Takeout in case things go wrong (again). Turns out you can have it create .tgf files up up to 50GB instead of 2 or 4 GB max .zip files. Much better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Photos :: I turned Amazon Photos back on. Not sure why I turned it off. I have a prime membership which gives me unlimited photo storage. But they do want me to pay $59/year for videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally Ditch Google? :: I&rsquo;ve been threatening to completely ditch google for a while. Maybe this is the time to do it ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source/Self hosting solutions? :: Maybe it&rsquo;s time to look into self hosting and/or things like NextCloud or PixelFed? I still run a digital ocean droplet. I&rsquo;ve run various servers, networking and security solutions/home labs in the past. I&rsquo;ve also proven why it&rsquo;s good to let other people professionally run your infrastructure. What to do?</p>

			 <p>I visited the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, yesterday. It was sobering. The thing that surprised me most was the degree to which individuals were the bright spots, while governments—even the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; (the Allies)—were passively complicit.</p>
<p>On a Greek island, the Gestapo asked the local Orthodox priest for a list of Jews on the island. He wrote his own name, handed it to them, and said, &ldquo;Here is your list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In late 1944, the Allies were aware of what was happening at Auschwitz. Humanitarian groups begged the military to bomb the gas chambers and crematoria. The Allies bombed a nearby petroleum processing facility but left the killing chambers intact.</p>
<p>I walked into one room and saw a pile of hundreds of shoes taken from the condemned as they were about to die.</p>
<p>As the Nazis turned up the pressure in the 1930s, many Jews tried to leave Europe. A few, including Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, got out. Most didn’t. There was an international conference to discuss the problem, yet there were no significant increases in immigration quotas in the US, the UK, or most of the rest of the world. England resisted calls to allow immigration of Jews to Palestine. Boats of refugees were turned away. As the camps were liberated, there were moralizing speeches, and generals (Eisenhower) toured the carnage. Trials were held, but the damage was done. &ldquo;Peace in our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Nazis increased pressure in Denmark later in the war, individuals risked their lives to evacuate Jews to neutral Sweden.</p>
<p>A sign posted near the entrance of the museum says (paraphrasing), &ldquo;This museum is not an answer, but a question.&rdquo; My takeaway is that the problem is not &ldquo;them&rdquo; (Nazis**, Jews, etc.), or even &ldquo;us&rdquo; (the &ldquo;good guys,&rdquo; whoever that is), but me. The Orthodox priest nailed it. Individuals are the problem. Individuals are the solution.</p>
<p>** Note: This is rhetorical.  The Nazi&rsquo;s were a big problem.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently reading a book called &ldquo;Cod&rdquo; (<a href="">https://www.kitchenartsandletters.com/products/cod-p-a-biography-of-the-fish-that-changed-the-world</a>). It takes a look at the last 3/400 years of history in relation to commercial activity around the cod fish. It makes a compelling case that the cod-fishing industry was a driver in, for instance, both slavery and the American revolution &hellip; and that maybe the Basque where in the new world before Columbus. The fact that the Pilgrams nearly starved close to Cape Cod in 1620/21, with one of the richest fisheries on the planet right next door seems to be due to an impressive combination of ignorance and incompetence.</p>
<p>My father was stationed with the army in St. John&rsquo;s Newfoundland in 1959. We took a tent camper-trip up there in &lsquo;68 (and I went back in ~81). I have pictures he took on my living room wall of masted fishing boats, the docks of a small fishing village, and small fising dories in St. John Harbor. My memory was that the fishing had collapsed between &lsquo;59 and &lsquo;68, but apperently Canada allowed cod fishing up to the 90s. I remember that we bought a salt cod, let it soak overnight, cooked it, and it was STILL almost all salt.</p>
<p>The book is a good read.</p>

<p>This is an example of how I use ChatGPT to write articles and blog posts.
This is the draft of an article for the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club&rsquo;s &ldquo;Potomac Appalachian&rdquo;
monthly newsletter.  It describes the work of the &ldquo;Cadillac Crew&rdquo; on it&rsquo;s March 2025 work trip.</p>
<p>My general approach is to write something myself, then to ask ChatGPT for feedback.
I usually hand-edit it&rsquo;s suggestions into successive drafts because I find that
it tends to eliminate my voice and my very intentional word-plays.
I find that it is usually a very excellent proof-reader and that it
provides good stylistic and flow analysis.</p>

<p>On the weeend of March 21-13 the Cadilac Crew gathered at Bears Den to continue
work in the &ldquo;Roller Coaster&rdquo; section of the Applachian Trail leading to Ravens
Rock.  Saturday was bueatiful spring day and the constant stream of hikers
made it clear why this popular section needed to be improved: the heavy
traffic has taken it&rsquo;s toll over the years exposing rock and roots. The trail
keeps shifing downhill off it&rsquo;s original location because
hikers invariably walk downhill to avoid rocks, widening it as they do so.</p>
<p>Friday night we arived at Bears Den where host Glenn welcomed the crew,
providing beds and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Saturday began with a short drive to the work site.   We accessed
the work site from private property (with permission) near the work site.
District managers Chris Brnuton and Rob Lamar had flagged
an ad-hoc trail up to the work site. Nobody wants to carry
heavy tools through the roller-coaster!</p>
<p>Robert Fina arrived with his truck-o-tools which were distributed.
We had a &ldquo;safety circle&rdquo; talk where everyone contributed one
saftey tip.</p>
<p>The work site was about 0.9 miles north of Snickers Gap. The focus
was on removing rocks, moving the trail back uphill and improving the
tread. This involved digging two large pits to extract mineral soil,
digging out some rocks, using a grip hoist to pull larger rocks
out of the ground and off the trail, removing organic soil and rebuilding
the surface with smaller rocks (large gravel) and mineral soil.</p>
<p>Near the end of the project, we were able to observe the results:
hikers were following the new, smoother path we had created and
not walking off trail for better footing.</p>
<p>Back at Bears Den we cleaned up, had a &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; and
a fine potluck dinner.  Songs were sung.  Card games were played
(&ldquo;Up And Down The River&rdquo; is apparently a Cadillac Crew favorite).
Agressive relaxation was done</p>
<p>SUNDAY WORK FOCUSED ON …</p>
<p>A fun time was had by most,  at least after a little Ibuprpophen and a shower.
First timers included X,X and X.  Second timers included Y, Y and Y.

<p>Title: The Cadillac Crew smooths the ride on the rollercoaster</p>
<p>By Robert Fina:
The Cadillac Crew work on the AT near Snickers Gap has required much rock removal from the treadway. Small rocks can be levered out with a pick or rock bars, but that technique is slow and labor intensive for larger and mostly buried rocks. For these, we developed a process using a grip hoist to pull the rocks free from the soil. Since getting a chain around a buried rock is difficult, first we use a gas power rock drill to make a hole in the rock on the opposite side of the rock from the grip hoist. Then a steel rod is inserted into the hole. The grip hoist cable is attached to the bar with a short length of chain. Cranking on the grip hoist gradually, and easily, pulls the rock out of the ground. Once it is lifted out of the ground a bit,  crew members crib it up by tossing smaller rocks beneath. If necessary, a chain can be looped around the rock to pull it out the rest of the way, and into its final location off the trail. With an experienced crew of 3 or 4, we can remove a big rock every 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>A cold and icy start to the Cadillac Crew’s season
By Karen Brown, Eddie Becton, Martha Becton et. al.</p>
<p>What does a trail crew do when the thermometer dips below freezing and the ground is covered with ice and snow?</p>
<p>Well, they build trails!</p>
<p>Though morning temps hovered around 10 degrees, the Cadillac Crew started our January weekend snug in the lovingly-restored Mountain Home Bed &amp; Breakfast of Front Royal, lucky guests of owners Lisa and Scott.</p>
<p>Mountain Home’s listings on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places made the Crew’s weekend an exceptional treat with its mid-1800s architecture and Greek Revival details.  While the front part of the Main House was built in 1847, part of the foundation dates back to the 1780s.  Mountain Home’s rich history can be explored as a guest or through the B&amp;B’s website.</p>
<p>After a hearty breakfast we were off to Tuckers Lane parking lot and AT trailhead to work on a beautiful section recommended by District Managers Jon Rindt and Maston Gray.  Jon and section maintainer George Jones joined us for the day as welcomed additions. The trail had been scouted by crew leader, Dan Feer, and George Jones and Tysha Robinson who spotted decaying steps and lots of washed-out tread —our specialty!</p>
<p>Equipped with hand warmers and microspikes to combat the cold and icy trail, crew members Eddie Becton, Martha Becton, Karen Brown, Maria de la Torre, Alice DeCarlo, Kirsten Elowsky, Dan Feer, Ellen Feer, Robert Fina, George Jones, Jonathan Kauffman, James Martin, Don Oellerich, Cat Randall, Jon Rindt, Tysha Robinson, Alisa Schaefer, Ellen Shaw, Dan Wooley, and Mark Wrobel broke into small groups. Some worked on rolling grade dips to improve tread drainage and trail maintainability.  To boost hiker safety, others replaced log stairs and the rest on a very short section of new trail around dangerous log stairs.</p>
<p>The first task for all of us was simply getting to the ground below the ice and snow. Ellen Feer spent hours at the trailhead clearing the hazardous ice covering the bridge and stone steps while the rest of us got to work digging through the ice and snow on the trial. Even this much exertion couldn’t keep our toes from getting cold, so imagine how we welcomed the hot chocolate and marshmallows Kirsten provided at lunchtime!</p>
<p>The low afternoon sun cast long shadows on freshly-finished rolling grade dips, scattered saw dust from removed dead trees and cut logs, newly-built wooden steps, and finishing touches on the bypass. Gratefully we carpooled back to hot baths, happy hour, a delicious dinner and toasty beds.</p>
<p>Sunday was a little warmer, so we tackled a few more erosion issues. More rolling grade dips coming up! A steep section needed steps, but appropriate rocks were not to be found. Robert, C sawyer and Karen, swamper selected a standing dead locust tree along the trail with good wood for steps. Before felling it, Robert squared the sides, cut notches for pegs and cut it to length. Once down, the pegs were cut from the stump to secure the step. The Crew installed the stairs with amazing results.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful winter weekend to welcome new member Maria, appreciate second-timers James and Jonathan and reconnect with old friends. Join us next month. Send a note to <a href="mailto:ccrewpatc@gmail.com">ccrewpatc@gmail.com</a> to find out how.</p>

<p>Cadillac Crew Makes the Rough Places Plain
By: George Jones with help from ChatGPT</p>
<p>On the weeend of March 21-13 the Cadilac Crew gathered at Bears Den to continue work in the &ldquo;Roller Coaster&rdquo; section of the Applachian Trail leading to Ravens Rock. Saturday was bueatiful spring day and the constant stream of hikers made it clear why this popular section needed to be improved: the heavy traffic has taken it&rsquo;s toll over the years exposing rock and roots. The trail keeps shifing downhill off it&rsquo;s original location because hikers invariably walk downhill to avoid rocks, widening it as they do so.</p>
<p>Friday night we arived at Bears Den where host Glenn welcomed the crew, providing beds and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Following a hearty breakfast, Saturday began with a short drive to the work site. We accessed the work site from private property (with permission) near the work site. District managers Chris Brnuton and Rob Lamar had flagged an ad-hoc trail up to the work site. Nobody wants to carry heavy tools through the roller-coaster!</p>
<p>Robert Fina arrived with his truck-o-tools which were distributed. We had a &ldquo;safety circle&rdquo; talk where everyone contributed one saftey tip.</p>
<p>The work site was about 0.9 miles north of Snickers Gap. The crew&rsquo;s focus was on removing rocks, moving the trail back uphill and improving the tread. This involved digging two large pits to extract mineral soil, digging out some rocks, using a grip hoist to pull larger rocks out of the ground and off trail, removing organic soil and rebuilding the tread with smaller rocks (large gravel) and mineral soil.</p>
<p>Near the end of the project, we were able to observe the results: hikers were following the new, smoother path we had created and not walking off trail for better footing.</p>
<p>Back at Bears Den we cleaned up, had a &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; and a fine potluck dinner. Songs were sung. Card games were played (&ldquo;Up And Down The River&rdquo; is apparently a Cadillac Crew favorite). Agressive relaxation was done</p>
<p>SUNDAY WORK FOCUSED ON …</p>
<p>A fun time was had by most, at least after a little Ibuprpophen and a shower. First timers included X,X and X. Second timers included Y, Y and Y. We’d love for you to join us next month!

<p><strong>*Comparison of the Revised Draft with the January Article</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Structure and Flow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The revised draft is structured chronologically, similar to the January article, which helps guide the reader through the events of the weekend. Both articles start with an introduction, provide a detailed description of the work performed, and conclude with encouragement for future participation.</li>
<li>The revised draft could benefit from a more detailed transition between sections, similar to the January article, which smoothly connects activities and reflections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detail and Technical Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The January article incorporates specific details about the tools and techniques used by the crew, which enhances the reader’s understanding of the work&rsquo;s complexity. For example, Robert Fina&rsquo;s explanation of the grip hoist process adds depth. The revised draft mentions rock removal and trail improvement but lacks similar technical specifics, which could enhance engagement.</li>
<li>Including information about specific tasks and challenges faced, as in the January article, would add depth to the revised draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personal Touches and Team Dynamics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The January article highlights individual contributions and team dynamics more extensively, creating a sense of community. While the revised draft mentions first-timers and second-timers briefly, it could be enriched with anecdotes or personal experiences of members to align better with the camaraderie portrayed in the January piece.</li>
<li>The mention of &ldquo;aggressive relaxation&rdquo; and card games in the revised draft adds some personal touch but could be expanded for more warmth and character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tone and Engagement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both drafts aim for a friendly, inviting tone. The revised draft&rsquo;s encouragement to &ldquo;join us next month&rdquo; aligns well with the January article&rsquo;s call to action. However, integrating more warmth and excitement throughout the narrative could keep readers more engaged.</li>
<li>The tone in the revised draft shifts towards a casual style towards the end, similar to the January article&rsquo;s conclusion, which can effectively invite participation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Call to Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both articles effectively conclude with invitations to engage in future activities. The revised draft&rsquo;s section encouraging new participants is succinct and clear, similar to the January article’s efficient call to action.</li>
<li>However, the revised draft could benefit from a stronger concluding statement that encapsulates the crew&rsquo;s shared experiences and accomplishments over the weekend, similar to the reflective tone of the January article&rsquo;s ending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, while the revised draft effectively follows the structure and tone of the January article, adding more technical detail, personal anecdotes, and cohesive transitions would enhance its appeal and engagement for readers.</p>

<p><strong>Cadillac Crew Makes the Rough Places Plain in the Roller Coaster</strong><br>
By: George Jones, Robert Fina and ChatGPT</p>
<p>On the weekend of March 21-23, the Cadillac Crew gathered at Bear’s Den to continue work in the &ldquo;Roller Coaster&rdquo; section of the Appalachian Trail leading to Ravens Rock. Saturday was a beautiful spring day, and the constant stream of hikers made it clear why this popular section needed to be improved: heavy traffic has taken its toll over the years, exposing rock and roots. The trail keeps shifting downhill off its original location because hikers invariably walk downhill to avoid rocks, widening it as they do so.</p>
<p>Friday night, we arrived at Bear’s Den, where host Glenn welcomed the crew, providing beds and fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Following a hearty breakfast, Saturday began with a short drive to the work site. We accessed the worksite from private property (with permission) near the trail. District managers Chris Bruton and Rob Lamar had flagged an ad-hoc trail up to the worksite. Creating an accessible route to the worksite was crucial; nobody wants to carry heavy tools through the roller-coaster!</p>
<p>Robert Fina arrived with his truck-o-tools, which were distributed. We gathered for a &ldquo;safety circle&rdquo; talk, where everyone contributed one safety tip, emphasizing our commitment to safety on the trail.</p>
<p>The worksite was about 0.9 miles north of Snickers Gap. Our primary focus was on removing rocks, moving the trail back uphill, and improving the tread. This involved digging two large pits to extract mineral soil, digging out some rocks, and employing a grip hoist to pull larger rocks out of the ground and off the trail.</p>
<p>Robert described the grip hoist process: “Getting a chain around a buried rock can be challenging. First, we use a gas-powered rock drill to make a hole in the rock on the opposite side from the grip hoist. Then a steel rod is inserted into the hole, and the grip hoist cable is attached to the bar with a short length of chain. Gradually cranking on the grip hoist pulls the rock free. Once slightly lifted, crew members crib it up with smaller rocks beneath. If needed, we can loop a chain around it to pull it out the rest of the way and into its final location off the trail.”</p>
<p>We removed organic soil and rebuilt the tread with smaller rocks (like gravel) and mineral soil. The combination of mineral soil and gravel enhances the durability of the trail, ensuring it can withstand heavy foot traffic for years to come.</p>
<p>As the work progressed, we observed visible improvements. Near the end of the project, it was rewarding to see hikers following the new, smoother path we had created, rather than walking off-trail in search of better footing.</p>
<p>Back at Bear’s Den, we cleaned up and transitioned to a &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; and a fine potluck dinner.  Songs were sung. Card games were played (&ldquo;Up And Down The River&rdquo; is a Cadillac Crew favorite). After a long day of hard work aggressive relaxation ensued!</p>
<p>SUNDAY WORK FOCUSED ON …</p>
<p>Overall, these improvements will help PATC in achieving its mission of &ldquo;Connecting people to the outdoors&rdquo; with trails that will last for years to come.</p>
<p>As the day wrapped up, a fun time was had by all, after a little ibuprofen and a hot shower! First-timers included X, X, and X; second-timers included Y, Y, and Y. We’d love for you to join us next month! Just drop a note to <a href="mailto:ccrewpatc@gmail.com">ccrewpatc@gmail.com</a> to learn how you can participate.</p>

<p>First-timer Greg Wilson had this to say of the experience:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect when I agreed to volunteer to help with trail maintenance.  All I was told was to wear clothing that I didn&rsquo;t mind getting dirty.  This advice was given, for the record, by a crew member who worked in a nice Patagonia sweater.  I spent much of the day &ldquo;mining&rdquo; next to the base of a fallen tree as I quickly learned that buckets of non-organic dirt are a critical component in trail maintenance.  I kept saying that &ldquo;mining&rdquo; is a fancy word for &ldquo;digging a hole&rdquo; but it did allow me to dream of mining for gold.  Although no gold was discovered, the many nice comments from passing hikers did make the whole experience worthwhile.  It is an amazing and dedicated crew and I look forward to joining future outings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A fun time was had by all, after a little ibuprofen and a hot shower! First-timers included X, X, and X; second-timers included Y, Y, and Y. We’d love for you to join us next month!

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week I designed a business card for a hiking group I&rsquo;m a part of. As someone with very little design experience, I used the opportunity to put my toe into the raging torrent of AI-everything.</p>
<p>I was able to get several very nice mock-ups from DALL.E. There were several #ChatGPT add-ons (I&rsquo;m not sure what they&rsquo;re called) that helped you design cards. They pretty much all pointed you to commercial services to finish the job. None of them pumped out a finished product.</p>
<p>Despite the appealing visuals, the #AI struggled with the text, hallucinating information and producing fuzzy lettering.</p>
<p>Faced with these challenges, I considered various options: I could pay for one of the AI-driven services recommended by ChatGPT or revert to a more traditional approach, reminiscent of the 2000s, by using Open Office for a hands-on design.</p>
<p>I struck a compromise and ended up doing the layout by hand using staples.com&rsquo;s online program, borrowing ideas from DALL.E&rsquo;s good first swags.</p>
<p>I had a related experience yesterday: I tried using one of the now ubiquitous AI-Chatbots on a medical website&hellip; it was pathetic, inept and a waste of time. I ended up calling a customer service /person/. He was confused by my issue that was not on the call script, but he was able to /understand/.</p>
<p>This blog post was proofread by ChatGPT. Some suggestions for flow, grammar and style were incorporated. Again, decisions where made by a human as to what changes to incorporate.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: AI helps, but for some jobs, you still need a lot of human judgent, creativity and &ldquo;manual labor&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks of my experiment I went more-or-less &ldquo;cold
turkey&rdquo; on the smartphone.  The phone was just off most of the time.  Lately, I&rsquo;ve
been a little more willing to have it on to listen to podcasts or be
reachable when needed.   I&rsquo;ve found that the attitudes developed during
the first few weeks are useful: A very conscious awareness of when
the phone is on and why, and an active antagonism towards letting it
interrupt my train of thought.  When it&rsquo;s on, it&rsquo;s on for one
purpose that I choose and then gets turned off.   I don&rsquo;t, e.g.,
compulsively check email or &ldquo;google&rdquo; things just because it&rsquo;s on.</p>

<p>It turns out if you use older, single purpose devices for specific
tasks, contemporary advertisers can&rsquo;t reach you.  They expect you to
use your modern all-in-one advertising delivery platform.  Just don&rsquo;t.
It will ruin their day.</p>

<h3 id="what-time-is-it">What time is it?</h3>
<p>You really don&rsquo;t need your phone on to know the time. Look at a clock.
Use an old-school watch. Sit down at your computer … time is everywhere.
Look at the time on your standalone digital camera.</p>

<h3 id="kodak-moments-pictures">Kodak Moments, Pictures</h3>
<p>I pulled out a vintage 2003 digital
camera.  16MP + 5x optical zoom.  Works great.  No GPS tagging of
photos.  You have to choose to transfer them to your computer by
popping out the SIM card  or using a cable.  Then you have to
choose to add it (or not) to things like online photo albums.</p>
<p>This changes the defaults.  Your pictures are not first and
foremost in, e.g., Google&rsquo;s cloud (which they can delete at will).
They are on YOUR camera.  They are on YOUR computer if you choose
to them there.   They are on <em>their</em> cloud, only if you choose to
put them there.</p>
<p>We made physical picture albums up until about 2005.  I have
physical picture albums and photos for my family going back to the
late 1800s.  Maybe I should start making photo albums again.</p>

<p>I wanted to listen to music as I painted the back deck.

starting to sound bad, loosing magnetism.</p>

<h1 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h1>
<p>For now, keeping the phone off most of the time is helping me regain
control of my focus. I&rsquo;ve become more conscious of when and why I turn
it on and actively resist using it for any secondary purposes while
it&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p>Exploring retro technologies has been an amusing and arguably useful
experiment. Many everyday tasks can be accomplished without the constant
distraction of a smartphone. Bonus: no ads.</p>
<p>I haven’t owned a TV for most of the last 40 years, and I quit Facebook 8 years
ago for the same reasons: to maintain control over my time and attention.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll continue exploring life without the smart phone
incrementally and may eliminate it.</p>
<p>Of course, the real battle is with my own willingness to be distracted.
No tech fix will address that.</p>

			 <p>This morning I read an article on the life of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Howe">Henry Howe</a>, the
definitive historian of 19th Century Ohio.  I have deep roots in
Ohio, so this was of personal interest.</p>

<h2 id="henry-howe-eyewitness-to-history">Henry Howe, eyewitness to history</h2>
<p>It might be fair to call Howe the &ldquo;Thucydides of Ohio History&rdquo;.  In
the 1840s, when many of the &ldquo;pioneers&rdquo; were still alive, he visited
almost every corner of the state talking to people, gathering
information, anecdotes and drawing sketches that were included in
his history.</p>
<p>He was the first American to fund a book&rsquo;s authorship with pre-sales.</p>
<p>Prior to the Ohio history, he had followed the same plan for New
York, antebellum Virginia and several other states.</p>
<p>At the very outbreak of the Civil War (April, 1861) he published the
unfortunately named &ldquo;Our Whole Country&rdquo; after 4 years and 18,000
miles of travel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of contemporary, primary sources. I think you would be hard
pressed to find someone more well traveled and with more eye-witness
accounts of 19th century America.</p>
<p>In the 1880s Howe repeated his travels throughout Ohio and published
and updated history of Ohio in 3 volumes. I think I still have a family
copy in the closet with all the &ldquo;family things&rdquo; that have come down
to me via the generations.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="my-ohio-history-connections">My Ohio History Connections</h2>
<p>My family has had some connections to important events and movements
in the state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Marietta:</strong> My personal history in Ohio goes back to it&rsquo;s very founding.
My Great-Great-Great grandfather Simon Porter was one of the group that
founded Marietta, the first town in the northwest territory.
You can read about that in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?field-keywords=9781501168703">David McCullough&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Pioneers&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Abolition Movement:</strong> One my ancestors attended the Lane Seminary in Cincinnati the
year of that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Seminary#The_slavery_debates">anti-slavery debates</a> there led to riots and the
cession of most of the student body to Oberlin college the next
year.  The president of the Lane Seminary was one Lyman Beecher, father of
Harriet Beecher-Stow of &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; fame.  I have a
handwritten notebook entitled &ldquo;Dr. Beecher&rsquo;s Lectures on Theology&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Underground Railroad:</strong> My Great-great grandfather ran a stop on the underground railroad in
his barn about a days walk north of Marietta.
It was likely the 2nd stop northward for those &ldquo;illegal immigrants&rdquo;
heading for Canada after crossing the Ohio River (no small feat).
We have a 1920s newspaper article written by my great grandmother describing how they obstructed slave
catchers and gave them the run-around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Civil War:</strong> My great grandfather was in an Ohio regiment of
Union army and saw action (and dug graves) at Vicksburg and other
locations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The history connection has continued in recent and current generations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dad&rsquo;s Ohio Travels and the Ohio Historical Society:</strong> My father spent 2 or
3 years as a photographer taking pictures of events around the
state for the &ldquo;Wonderful World of Ohio&rdquo; magazine, likely
following in many of Howe&rsquo;s footsteps 80+ years later. He then
spent 25 years working  at the Ohio Historical Society
microfilming newspapers from the 19th and 20th centuries,
preserving local history and genealogy, as well as some of the papers of President Harding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My own travels:</strong> Over the years I&rsquo;ve visited many Ohio history
sites including <a href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/browse-historical-sites/serpent-mound/">Serpent Mound</a>, the Wright Brothers aviation sites in Dayton, the
Neil Armstrong (1st moon landing) museum, Geologic sites such a
glacial grooves and Flint ridge and the homes of presidents.  I witnessed baseball
history in person when Cincinnati native Pete Rose (d. 2024) got hit 4,192 to pass
Ty Cobb on the all-time hit list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teaching history today:</strong> My son currently teaches history at a high school in Ohio.
A week or so ago, we visited the new <a href="https://stateparks.com/great_council_state_park_in_ohio.html">Great Council State Park</a>,
associated with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and Daniel Boone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="where-does-this-leave-us">Where does this leave us?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I have some of the historical context around the state I grew
up in and my family.  It reminds me that nobody&rsquo;s perfect and there
are always challenges in life.
I&rsquo;ve never had to disobey the law to do what was right (hiding
run-away slaves).  I&rsquo;ve never had to go to war.  I&rsquo;ve never had to
float down the Ohio river on a flatboat looking for a place to live
(and, yes, there are other perspectives on all these stories.)
I&rsquo;m glad Dad spent his career preserving the stories
of people all over the state microfilming newspapers.
I hope my son is able to pass on the love for history that has come
down to me though the generations.</p>
<p>What history connections do you have?  How do you benefit from what
you know?</p>

			 <p>Why do I value a clean car?</p>
<p>Yesterday we had car &ldquo;detailing&rdquo; done, which I only recently learned
means &ldquo;really good cleaning&rdquo;, not &ldquo;fancy painting&rdquo;. One of our cars
had had a leak. Water got in and it started to mold. So we called someone
to do a through interior cleaning. For double they price, the also offered
exterior cleaning, wax, and shine, etc.</p>
<p>I got to thinking about what motivates someone to pay for interior
verses exterior cleaning. Interior cleaning is about you enjoying being
in your own space.  Exterior cleaning is about what other people think
of you:</p>

			 <p>On Monday, I flew a #modelrocket that I had built sometime around 1974 for the first time. It flew higher than expected and got lost somewhere in the neighborhood around the school where we launched.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This was probably one of the last rockets I built as a kid. I spent a lot of time making it look good. Sometimes you lose rockets when you fly them; sometimes the chute fails to open and they nose into the ground, crushing the paper body tubes.</p>
<p>I launched with my oldest friend from childhood. We met in third grade when my dad ran a launch out back of our elementary school with the whole class watching. It was a three-stage rocket. The upper stage drifted off school property, and despite a large portion of the class looking for it, it was never recovered. We have been friends ever since. He kept up the hobby for life; I occasionally dabble in it still.</p>
<p>This was a D-engine rocket, higher power than anything I’d ever flown. I was pretty sure it would fly high. It had a narrow body, which reduced drag. It did indeed fly high—maybe 800 feet or more. Then we watched it drift over the school where we were launching and into the surrounding neighborhood. We sighted the rough landing area relative to some of the taller trees in the area and went looking for it. Despite talking to several neighbors and getting permission to search in backyards, it was gone.</p>
<p>I could have hung on to the rocket and never flown it. It already had acquired a few dents over the last 50 years of moves. If I’d hung on to it, someone else would eventually have just thrown it out.</p>
<p>I spent 50 years wondering what a D-powered flight would be like. I found out. It was fun—for about two minutes. Probably more fun than looking at it sitting above my workbench for the next 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>Some things have sentimental value and may be worth keeping. Some things just have to be enjoyed and set free.</p>
<p>Carpe Rocketem :-)</p>

<p>Observation - I have a constant urge to look up obscure facts, e.g.
&ldquo;tunes in common meter in a minor key&rdquo;. But I really don&rsquo;t need to
know. Looking these up is mostly passive, and provides a sort of dopamine
hit. Not knowing makes me find other ways to get the answer like &ldquo;look
at common meter tunes in a songbook that I know tends to have more
minor keys than others&rdquo; … I have to be active to find the answer,
maybe I won&rsquo;t find an answer, maybe it didn&rsquo;t matter in the first place,
I have to make a judgment about the value and utility of the information.
My mind is engaged in the whole process, whether or not I find an
answer.   I think keeping my mind active rather than passive is my
real goal.</p>

<p>The southern third of the 2,000-mile Appalachian Trail is closed: <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org/trail-updates/ga-va-tropical-storm-helene/">Appalachian
Trail Updates.</a> Bridges I&rsquo;ve crossed have washed away: <a href="https://youtu.be/uGhhjjC3G58?si=Xkc3Crb85LDBZE6b">Video
of a washout</a>. Hiker hostels are closed. I&rsquo;m sure there are thousands
of trees to clear and other damage for the trail clubs to repair. This
article from The Trek <a href="https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/our-town-has-been-decimated-more-details-emerge-about-status-of-at-trail-towns-in-helenes-aftermath/">shows
some of the devastation on the southern appalachian trial</a>. Unbelievable.
I&rsquo;ve been to all the places shown.  This blog has <a href="https://outdoorfoo.wordpress.com/2020/06/22/erwin-to-sams-gap/">some pictures from
one of my trips to Erwin</a>.  As a hiker, I feel for all the SOBOs
(Southbounders) and flip-floppers who took six months off life to hike
the trail. I met some of them a few weeks ago while on a training
hike. Those hikes are not gonna happen this year (and next?) south of Virginia.</p>

<h1 id="hiking-depends-on-a-support-system">Hiking depends on a support system</h1>
<p>Long distance hikers rely on a network of support: shuttle drivers, hostels, Dollar
Generals, as well as emergency rescue services and local hospitals.</p>
<p>Some of the hostels were underwater<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and at least one hospital
was flooded. Bridges are out, and there are undoubtedly thousands of
trees that need to be cleared. Emergency services will be slow at best,
and possibly non-existent. Fall and hit your head and need to go to
the hospital? Get lost and need to call for help with your GPS-enabled
pager? Break three ribs? (These examples are not made up .) You MIGHT
get help and rescue services, or you might not.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="theres-a-bigger-picture">There&rsquo;s a bigger picture</h1>
<p>Communities depend on a much larger support system that includes
roads, stores, power, hospitals, commerce, insurance, government,
churches, neighbors, friends, and family. Right now, much of that network is
down across an entire region of the country. They need time and
assistance to rebuild.</p>
<p>Normalcy is one of the conditions that allows hikers to take the moderate
risks they choose to take in better days. I&rsquo;ve visited many of the affected
communities recently. I’ve appreciated the experiences I’ve had there,
the people I’ve met, and the support they’ve provided me. For now,
though, restoring normalcy in the broader context is the priority.</p>
<p>Appreciate the support structures you have. You often don&rsquo;t think
about them until they&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<p>I lived the first 50+ years of my life before the smart-phone.
Advertising<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> came in a big fat insert to the Sunday newspapers.
You had to make the choice to look at them.  There were no annoying

Sure, there were ads on the radio (remember radio?) and in your TV
shows<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but
you were much more in control of your attention.</p>
<p>I know what life was like without the smart phone, and I know what
life is like now.  I&rsquo;m bothered by the attention-sucking nature of the
phone and I&rsquo;m running an experiment in just leaving it off.</p>
<p>Sure, my wife won&rsquo;t be able to text me.  I might not listen to as many
podcasts or anything on Audible or Amazon Music (cancel the
subscriptions? Bonu$$$ !).  I might have to make the choice to sit down at
my computer to read news/blogs/etc,  etc, but I&rsquo;ll be getting my mind
back.  Time is our most precious commodity.  The phone steals our
attention and, our focus, and, by proxy our time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got old patterns to go back to.  I know what
phone-less live was like.  For those born after, say, 2000, I&rsquo;m pretty
sure you&rsquo;d have a different experience.</p>
<p>You can never go back in time. You have to live in the world and time
you&rsquo;re in,
but in this case, I&rsquo;m going take a principal, that I want to control
my own time and attention, and try to apply it to the modern context.
In this case, the means to the end is minimizing use of smart-phones.</p>
<p>Wish me luck, but don&rsquo;t text me.  Unless it&rsquo;s on my Google voice number.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on a quest to leave my phone off for peace of mind, focus, etc.
One of the biggest challenges is authentication, e.g., banks wanting
to text you for 2FA, Google auth for one-time passwords, etc.</p>
<p>I use KeePassXC for my passwords.
This is a template for setting info about 2fa in my keepass entries
Notes section.  It will allow me to serach for things like
&ldquo;phone:Required:yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;phone:blocksGoogleVoice:yes.
Tags don&rsquo;t let you serach for partial matches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping it in notes of my KeePass account entries
rather than in a separate file (org mode or spreadsheet) because
&ldquo;When information exists in two places, one of them is wrong&rdquo;.
I Should be able to export if needed.</p>
<p>The meaing of the keys used below is:</p>

			 <p>Every get frustrated dealing with bureaucracies?</p>
<p>I think the thing that really ticks me off is that I&rsquo;m not being
treated as a person.  I&rsquo;m just another problem in someone&rsquo;s day &mdash; just
another voicemail, email or ticket in their inbox.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a two-way street. The real problem is the processes,
policies, and procedures that call center people, for example, are
forced to regurgitate. But they’re the only humans you deal with. It’s
hard to remain civil sometimes, even when they’re as much a victim
of the machine as you are.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to try some radical, old-school approaches wherever possible:
talk to people in person, get to know them by name.  Avoid email,
texting, portal messages, voicemail, and apps. Go there. Build trust.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are policies against that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

Our love is here
To stay ;
Not for a year
But ever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go!

Going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

<p>The lyrics assume that romantic interest is a solid basis for a lasting
relationship. Maybe? Sometimes? But as most of the literature and music
of at least the last 100 years (see the entire genre of the Blues)
shows, it can be very short-lived and the source of a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Other cultures have taken different approaches. Arranged marriages, for instance. I&rsquo;m just stirring the pot, but why is that wrong? Why not base things on rational choice?</p>
<p>The idea of romantic love is found throughout recorded history. Take
Cupid, for example—the mischievous little guy with a bow and arrow who
shoots his arrows at two people at random, causing them
to fall in love. The resulting relationship might have been socially
appropriate or not (think Romeo and Juliet).
His arrows were said to affect even the gods themselves. There was no escape.</p>
<p>Returning to my readings in ancient Rome, it seems that the Romans
did not, in general, marry for love—at least in the records we have.
Those records are  largely skewed towards the upper classes who wrote and left
records.</p>
<p>Pompey the Great married Julius Caesar&rsquo;s daughter, Julia, partly to keep the peace between them during the tense final years of the Republic. It worked until Julia died in childbirth, shattering the political bond between the two men. Civil war ensued.</p>
<p>Pompey actually fell in love with Julia… and was teased for it. It was not &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in that culture. Apparently, the emperor Severus Alexander had a similar &ldquo;problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rockies are still there. Gibraltar is still there. The radio? The telephone?</p>
<pre><code>But, oh my dear
But our love is here to stay
</code></pre>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve never heard the song, here&rsquo;s Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s version:

<pre><code>How can I migrate from Mastodon to Micro.blog?

You can consolidate your followers from a Mastodon instance to Micro.blog. 
First, add an alias to Micro.blog for your old     Mastodon instance under
Account → View Mastodon Details → Aliases. This tells Mastodon that you are
the owner of both accounts. Then initiate the move from within Mastodon to your 
Micro.blog username.

<p>The word &ldquo;Cincinatus&rdquo;, as in the city of Cincinnati,  comes from the Latin word &ldquo;cincinnus,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;curly-haired.&rdquo;   Classical Latin had hard &ldquo;c&quot;s, so this literally the same word as the English &ldquo;Kinky&rdquo;.

<p>Today&rsquo;s observations from reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780140441048">The Early History of Rome: Books I-V
of the History of Rome from its Foundation</a> by Livy  📚</p>
<h3 id="the-setting">The Setting</h3>
<p>A slave revolt has seized the citadel on top of Capitoline Hill. The Forum and the Senate House are literally at the foot of the hill, almost a stone’s throw away.</p>
<p>The tribunes of the plebs (in today’s terms, think some combination of public defender, speaker of the house, cop, and mob boss) had been arguing for a year with the patricians (the upper class) over the passage of a law to limit the power of the consuls (think co-presidents).</p>
<p>The fortress within the walls of Rome, home to the most sacred temples of the people, was literally in the hands of hostile, armed men. Think, I dunno, January 6th…</p>
<h3 id="time-for-more-legal-debates-">Time for more legal debates !!!</h3>
<p>The Capitoline was within sight and even earshot of where debates over
the law were taking place. Did the tribunes care? Nope. They wanted
the debate to continue on their proposed law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it when the enemy is over our heads that you decide that men shall
lay down their arms and discuss laws?’ Then turning to the Assembly
he said, ‘If, Quirites, you feel no concern for the City, no anxiety
for yourselves, still show reverence for your gods who have been taken
captive by an [3] enemy! Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Queen Juno and Minerva,
with other gods and goddesses, are being besieged; a camp of slaves
holds the tutelary deities of your country in its [4] power. Is this
the appearance which you think a State in its senses ought to present
—a large hostile force not only within the walls, but in the Citadel,
above the Forum, above the Senate-house, whilst meantime the Assembly
is being held in the Forum, the senate are in the Senate-house, and
as though peace and quiet prevailed, a senator is addressing the House,
whilst the Quirites in the Assembly are proceeding to [5] vote?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.+3+17&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026">www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/te&hellip;</a>&gt;</p>
<p>They even made up a conspiracy theory that the patricians had
orchestrated the rebellion to prevent debate on the law.</p>
<p>The more things change…</p>

			 <p>The arrest of telegram founder Pavel Durov bothers me. As someone raised
in the US, I have a fairly deep seated belief in freedom of speech,
association and freedom from unreasonable searches. To see
someone who enabled this in the digital age arrested for enabling
these freedoms, someone who no less
had to flee Russia to do it, bothers me.</p>
<p>Part of me says &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s find/create some tech to enable private
communication, but that&rsquo;s what Pavel did.  And The Powers That Be
don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I see parallels to my early work in security. &ldquo;If we can just find
the right tech, all the security problems will be solved: Firewalls,
Anti-Virus, Spam Filters, &hellip;.&rdquo;. But the problem was social, not purely
technical. The same seems to be true with private communication in
the digital age. The problem is human nature: people in power want
to control the dialog, they want to dictate the bounds of acceptable
discussion.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll look deeper in to Signal, Nostr or other alternatives
(suggestions?) so I can use them and recommend them to people 
needing private communications. I think I just won&rsquo;t have the illusion
this time that tech can solve the problem.</p>

			 <p>Hikers all have 1000 stories. When you hike, you meet people. You experience
things. What is that bug? Will it rain? If I get hurt, will anybody
come along on this trail? And why am I doing this anyhow?</p>

<p>You meet people.   Most of them are nice.   Sometimes the&rsquo;re not.
Sometimes the&rsquo;re like you.   Sometimes the&rsquo;re not.
You deal with it.   And often make new friends.</p>
<p>One thing you find is that life is stranger than fiction.
You can&rsquo;t make some of this stuff up …. a Cambodian Buddhist monk
hiking the Appalchian Trail in Georgia who did not know proper
procedures for keeping safe from bears, but told me about having to
deal with wild tigers and elephants ….</p>
<p>Yeah, I could sit on my couch (or at my computer writing blog posts)
all day, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as interesting as getting out there
meeting people and seeing what the world is like. The real world is
not a string of tokens ChatGPT could generate</p>

			 <p>Yesterday while on a walk, I had a conversation with Google Gemini
about the Emerald Ash Borer that is killing most of the north American
ash trees.   I decided to take the conversation in a contrarian
direction.  I asked it to list the positive effects of the death of
the ash trees.   It kept spouting the same rhetoric about loss of
bio-diversity, etc.  Mind you, I agree with most of what it said about
negative affects, I like a good ash baseball bat or Homeric-era ash
spear as much as the next guy, but I was interested in seeing where I
could and could not push the model.   It would not stop spouting its
line and caveating any attempt I made to have it list positive effects
(such as room for other species to grow).  I asked it to list its
assumptions;.  Then I asked it to assume that all its assumptions
about the death of the ash population being negative were all false
and simply list the positive effects of the death of the ash trees
with no caveating.  It finally did.   But when I asked to sing a song
about he benefits of death of ash trees, it then veered off into
canards about not offending anyone, to which I informed it that I was
offended by its refusal to deviate from the party line.</p>
<p>It is clear Gemini has a point of view. Its point of is largely in line
with environmental orthodoxy, the piles of texts it was trained on,
and likely the prevailing political views within Google. For example,
its past renderings of America&rsquo;s founding fathers were often non-white
???. Getting it to adopt a contrarian position was almost impossible.</p>
<p>This article was proof-read by Google Gemini.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we learn from history, it&rsquo;s that people don&rsquo;t
learn from history.</p>
<p><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/03/06/learn-history/">— Hegel?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading Livy&rsquo;s (d.17 AD) <em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm">History
of Rome</a></em>.  I&rsquo;ve read from the founding (Romulus) through the establishment
of the Republic so far. Many, MANY of the issues we debate today are not new.
Livy was writing in the reign of Augustus. At that point, the events
he was describing were 500 to 700 years old. Here were some of the
burning issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Term limits</li>
<li>The rule of law</li>
<li>Favoritism and insider privilege</li>
<li>Immigration</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sanctuary Cities&rdquo;</li>
<li>Assimilation of immigrants</li>
<li>Citizenship</li>
<li>Kingdom vs. Republic vs. Democracy</li>
<li>Democracy requiring citizens prepared accept its responsibilities</li>
<li>Shared power/checks and balances</li>
<li>Roles for the masses, the aristocracy, and a strong executive</li>
<li>Explicit classes based on wealth</li>
<li>Enfranchisement and military responsibility based on class</li>
<li>Hereditary privilege vs newcomers</li>
<li>Hereditary privilege vs meritocracy</li>
<li>Religion and State (&ldquo;Separation of&rdquo; was not a concept then)</li>
<li>Morals and character as a foundation of good leadership</li>
<li>A sense of destiny</li>
<li>A need to explain a society/country&rsquo;s greatness</li>
<li>A need to check the excesses of ambition</li>
<li>A need to allow rewards for ambition and hard work</li>
<li>Peruasive public speaking/campaign speeches</li>
<li>Public posturing in legal cases</li>
<li>Backroom politics/king-making</li>
<li>A balance between military, civil and religious authority</li>
<li>The family as the foundation of society</li>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>The role of women</li>
<li>Patriarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some fairly well-known stories in there as well: Romulus
and Remus, Lucretia, and this guy named Brutus driving out a king,
as his descendant/namesake would do ~500 years later with the murder
of Julius Caesar. The republic ran another 3/400 years (down almost
to Livy&rsquo;s day), the western empire ~500 years after that, and Byzantium
(the eastern empire) down to the 1400s (just before Columbus).
More lessons to be learned there?  Probably (cf. Machiavelli).</p>
<p>So are there new issues?  Maybe.   Have we solved all the old ones?
Probably not.  Can we ignore what&rsquo;s gone before?  Yes.   Will be
deluding ourselves and needlessly re-fighting old battles and
re-inventing wheels if we do?</p>

			 <p>What risks do you take?  Why?  Do you think about it, or just do it?</p>
<p>In a recent post, <a href="https://micro.blog/jarrod">@jarrod</a> said &ldquo;Much like I think it&rsquo;s important to
do hard things, I also think it&rsquo;s important to make yourself do scary
things from time to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not generally a big risk taker, but I started hiking the
Appalachian Trail in 2008, and I simply go where it goes, and take
what it gives.  I&rsquo;m on track to finish next summer.</p>
<p>Last fall I found myself climbing up Sugarloaf moutian in Maine,
something like 1000' in 1/2 mile.   This was not hiking.   There are
lots of places like that where you think, &ldquo;Hmm, wish I could rope in&rdquo;,
but nope, that&rsquo;s just where the &ldquo;trail&rdquo; goes.  You just do it.
And hope it&rsquo;s not raining when you do.</p>
<p>Snakes like warm rocks.   They often blend in very well.  Sometimes
you almost sit on them or step on them without noticing.  Sometimes
another hiker happens to see you about to do it and warns you.
Sometimes.</p>
<p>A few months ago my son and I hiked the &ldquo;Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania&rdquo;.
The trail goes <strong>right next to</strong> the canyon quite a bit of the time.
I&rsquo;m not a fan of heights. Trails go by cliff sides quite regularly.</p>
<p>Bears a fairly common sight where I go.   Generally, don&rsquo;t bother
them, they don&rsquo;t bother you.   Don&rsquo;t feed them, make eye contact, run
away.  Hiking in groups helps because apparently bears cant count past
2 or 3 (&ldquo;One hiker, Two hikers, TOO MANY hikers…&quot;).  Making yourself
look large is also supposedly good.   And of course, smells.  They
can&rsquo;t see well, buy they can smell 20 times better than you.  Hang
your food.  Keep it out of your tent.</p>
<p>Then there are the guys-in-cammo-wtih-dogs-guns-and-knives who don&rsquo;t
quite fit in with the hiker crowd.  One of them had big black dogs
that another hiker commented on &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure he could control his
dogs if they got away&rdquo;.   Of course he camped right by the outhouse
and the dogs barked at anyone who came near all night.</p>
<p>Then there is the hike I hope to do next year, up Mount Washington
where it snows 12 months out of the year, and where the highest wind
speed ever recorded on the surface of the planet was measured.
You&rsquo;ve above tree line.   People die there every year, even in sight
of the shelters.  That&rsquo;s a hike I plan on taking very seriously.</p>

			 <p>Some perspective from a person who spent decades providing financial
advice, planning for retirement and was then diagnosed with brain cancer

<p>For the past couple years, I&rsquo;ve been reading/learning a ton from the
retirement-related web site <a href="https://humbledollar.com/">HumbleDollar</a>, which is run by Johnathan
Clements, who, for almost 20 years wrote the Wall Street Journal
persnal finance column.   He was recently diagnosed, at 61, with a
form of brain cancer that gives him at most a couple years to live.
His determination, transparency, and positive attitude in dealing with
it, very publicly, has been inspiring.  Something like this brings
clarity to what&rsquo;s important, and what&rsquo;s not.   I&rsquo;m grateful that he&rsquo;s
sharing his journey and his thoughts.   I&rsquo;m hoping to learn from his
experience and improve my approach to life (and death, and money and time)</p>
<p>Here are a couple quotes from his most recent article:</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/08/on-the-clock/">humbledollar.com/2024/08/o&hellip;</a>&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;I’m determined to make the most of every day, doing what I
love and trying mightily to fend off life’s nonsense. It’s an attitude
I recommend to readers—one I’d encourage you to embrace now, rather
than waiting for a dire medical prognosis. We should never forget that
our most precious resource isn’t money, but time.</p>
<p>Moments of irritation also occasionally creep in. Soon after I got my
diagnosis, it seemed the insurance company was dragging its feet,
taking far too long to approve my treatment plan. I was bothered by
the delay. But mostly, I was bothered that this bothered me—that I was
wasting time being angry at some lumbering, unresponsive insurance
company. That meant a day that wasn’t as good as it could be.</p>

			 <p>Today was the day I removed the TNI (Telephone Network Interface) from
my house.   The last vestiges of our land line. The last outpost of a
once vast network.</p>

<p>There used to be vast infrastructure (the Telephone Network) that got
phone calls from place to place. I remember sometime around 1969 (cub
scouts?  Elementary school?) touring the local AT&amp;T building that
housed rows and rows of mechanical switches that routed phone calls in
our neighborhood.  For those with an eye for it, those buildings are
still everywhere to be seen.   Square.  Few windows.  Brick.   In
virtually every neighborhood.</p>
<p>There was the Microwave relay tower near my grandfathers farm. Part
of a nationwide network that supported the &ldquo;Long lines&rdquo;, where AT&amp;T
made it&rsquo;s money until Judge Green broke it up, costing the world Bell
Labs (creator of the Transistor and Unix) in the process.</p>
<p>I recently stayed at a friends house, vintage 1920s. It has a little
alcove in the wall just off the kitchen that was undoubtedly for &ldquo;the
phone&rdquo;. Growing up we had &ldquo;the kitchen phone&rdquo;, and one on my dad&rsquo;s
desk. When it rang sometimes you had to dash to the other room to answer.</p>
<p>Phones like the one pictured above could be thrown down the basement
stairs onto a concrete floor and survive. Not that I would know. Bell
ENGINEERED their hardware.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we have moved beyond that technology, but it made the world
move for over a hundred years.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m going to subvert the system and try to connect with humans I talk
to in call centers as humans &hellip; at least until they are all replaced
by AI.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My life has taken a turn where it looks like I will be talking to lots of
customer service people on the phone: medical stuff, tax stuff,
insurance stuff.  Oh joy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no fun for me, but even less fun for them. They are likely working
an 8-5 job (at best), dealing with angry frustrated people for low
pay, having their calls recorded by &ldquo;the man&rdquo;, fed to AI for analysis,
graded on how quickly they get people off the phone, with often no
knowledge of the big picture, and no empowerment (or encouragement)
to actually understand and solve problems that are not on their call
script&hellip;.generally a bad place to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to subvert the system with each call.   My goal
(beyond getting insurance bills corrected, etc) will be to connect
with the human on the line.  To get their name, to read their mood,
to connect on some human topic, likely small.</p>
<p>Some will likely be annoyed or threatened by anything that takes them
off script or out of their role or adds 3 seconds to their measured
time on phone per call, but I think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge the
humans in the system when we do manage to get past the AI chatbots.</p>
<p>I/they may be rewarded with Winston Smith (1984)/Sam Lowry (Brazil)
torture in the end (or just having the system refuse to fucntion in
mindless fashion), but I think the small act of humane rebellion will
be it&rsquo;s own reward.</p>
<p>This is post #3/8 for  <a href="https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/">Blaugust 2024</a>. Joining late. I think I can make 8 posts :-)  Yes, it&rsquo;s a repost. I&rsquo;m also learning how to automate image upload in micro.blog.</p>

<p>It is somehow fitting that the day I retire, the state of Ohio chose
to unveil an historical marker outside the former headquarters of my
first employer, CompuServe. I guess I&rsquo;m history :-)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>I started in June of 1985, and, looking back, what was going
on there was world changing: the first commercial email, the first
online banking, the first online shopping, the first electronic news
wire feed, the first song released exclusively online (Arrowsmith 1994),
online chat (CB), OS and compiler development, VPNs (X.25 !), data
over cable in &lsquo;82 &hellip;</p>
<p>In the course of my career, it turns out that many of the things that
mattered wound up coming out of individual side projects, not grand
corporate visions.</p>
<h2 id="side-projects"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Side projects</h2>
<h3 id="the-eternal-september-sorry-dot"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Eternal September, sorry.</h3>
<p>One of my earliest lasting contributions resulted from a side
project that I put my good friend  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlkleinpaste/">karl kleinpaste</a>, up to:
creating the first Compuserve <code>&lt;-&gt;</code> Internet mail gateway
as a skunk-works project while we were both working at Ohio State Computer
Science. Karl followed up with a USENET <code>&lt;-&gt;</code> CompuServe gateway,
which was soon copied by AOL leading to the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Eternal_September">eternal september</a>
Sorry.</p>
<p>Eternal September seems to be about to repeat it self with
facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;threads&rdquo; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/mastodon-founder-touts-threads-federation-saying-it-makes-his-x-rival-a-far-more-attractive-option/">implementing a gateway to Mastadon</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-browser-that-never-was"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Web Browser that never was</h3>
<p>Then there was this web browser I wrote at CompuServe that would have
let the masses access the WWW before most people had even dial-up Internet.
But the corporate powers-that-be we&rsquo;re not sure this web thing was
going to catch on, so it was never released. Vision !!!</p>
<p>It depended on a graphics library and the WinCIM interface
developed by
<a href="http://curious.galthub.com/blog/2022-03-24/">Steve Wilhite</a>
(of GIF fame)</p>
<h3 id="the-editor-that-created-linux"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The editor that created Linux</h3>
<p>In early CompuServe days, Wilhite  and I did
a little collaborative coding to to improve
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroEMACS">MicroEmacs</a>,
I posted the source code to the Usenet group comp.sources.amiga and it took on a life
of it&rsquo;s own thanks to Daniel Laurence, first being called
MicroGNUEmacs until RMS himself objected to the use of &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; in the
name.
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/uemacs">Linus Torvalds (he of Linux fame) maintains a verison of MicroEmacs.</a>
And
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2013/03/emacs-chat-carsten-dominik/">Carsten Dominik</a>,
creator of
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode (&ldquo;Your life in plain text&rdquo;)</a>
was an early user and was influenced by it.</p>
<p>Org Mode is central to most parts of my life today.  What goes around,
comes around.</p>
<h3 id="sans-ietf-flocon-the-white-house"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> SANS, IETF, Flocon, the White House</h3>
<p>Along the way I wrote <a href="http://port111.com/george/talks/Jones-2002-SANS.pdf">The Router Audit Tool (RAT)</a>.
Offshoots of this work
fed indirectly (via XCCDF) into the creation of STIX and TAXII.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-n-stewart/">John Stewart</a>,
the venture capitalist and former CISO and VP of Cisco and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neal-ziring-779890a9/">Neil Ziring</a>,
tech director at NSA, contributed code to the project while I was
leading it.  Alan Paller of SANS convinced me to release it through
the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security</a> as one of their benchmark tools.
RAT started as a side project at UUNET.</p>
<p>Also at UUNET I started what became RFC3871:
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3871">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3871</a>.  The IETF OpSec working group
continues to this day as an offshoot (&ldquo;Many fine lunches&rdquo;?).  This was
a side project that spanned UUNET and MITRE.</p>
<p>While at CERT (CERT/CC at Carnegie-Mellon, the original CERT, not
US-CERT) I had the opportunity to chair <a href="https://www.flocon.org/">https://www.flocon.org/</a> twice.
This was something of a side project for the organization, but one
that got resources (my time).</p>
<p>Also at CERT I had the opportunity to provide netflow analysis
training to the White House SOC.</p>
<h3 id="side-projects-at-palo-alto"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Side projects at Palo Alto</h3>
<p>At Expanse/Palo Alto I spent a lot of time staring  at Internet scan
data, trying to figure out what vulnerable devices were presenting
themselves to us (and hackers). An irony here being that 15 years earlier we thought
scanning was always bad, and there were PhD theses around how to detect
it.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpcollins/">Mike Collins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/mcollins_at_isi/acknowledged_scanners">is still cataloging scan traffic</a>
(give it up Mike, Internet traffic IS scan traffic :-))</p>
<p>After Palo Alto acquired Expanse, I spent a fair bit of time understanding the
vast array security-related data available for analysis in other parts
of the company. In my judgment, Palo Alto may have the best overall
collection of data for analyzing and addressing security threats, second,
possibly, only to AWS. They actively work to use these data sources
to protect customers, see
<a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2014/10/web-security-tips-pan-db-works/">PanDB</a>,
for instance. I presented on my findings
at an annual internal meeting of researchers.  A side project.</p>
<p>As part of that effort I met
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janos-szurdi-b40b3598/">Janos Szurdi</a>
and collaborated with him
and other AMAZING researchers in that division, mostly on informal
projects such as an internal &ldquo;Hackathon&rdquo;, my role mostly being to
advise on the use of Expanse datasets.  The result can be seen in
<a href="https://janos.szurdi.com/blog/stockpiled-detector/">Janos&rsquo; blog post about detecting stockpiled domains</a></p>
<p>At this year&rsquo;s internal research meeting
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-hofmockel-a31437100/">Tim Hofmockel</a>
and I explored further
applications of combining data sources to support security analysis to solve
our customers challenges.
Such meetings are side projects for everyone, but the in-person interactions
that happen there are what gets the creative and collaborative juices
flowing and are often the source of further outside-the-box projects.
I think that&rsquo;s why I like them, and why companies fund them.</p>
<p>There is a possible patent coming out of some side efforts (this would
be the first of my career).</p>
<h2 id="the-amazon-leadership-principals"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Amazon Leadership Principals</h2>
<p>There is one set of corporate mumbo-jumbo I actually believe in:
the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">Amazon Leadership Principals</a>.  They stick with you.  They form a
way of thinking about the world and getting things done: Dive Deep,
Learn and Be Curious, Bias for Action, Earn Trust, Disagree and
Commit, Deliver Results.  It&rsquo;s said that some Amazonians have to try
hard to turn them off with family.</p>
<p>I think one of the reason those struck such a cord with me is that
I saw them modeled 10 years before Amazon was founded at an early,
impressionable period in my carrer. You could not have found a better
description of Steve Wilhite (but one would have to add laconic, curmudgeonly,
self-assured, stubborn and a few other adjectives)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding my Amazon stock despite Andy Jassey now being in charge
and the FTC going on an anti-trust fishing expedition.  The company is
solid. And the leadership principals and customer obsession are a
large part of it.</p>
<h2 id="people-matter-dot"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> People matter.</h2>
<p>Yes, you have to have corporate vision statements to keep investors
happy and make HR VPs think they are relevant, but so often what matters
are the side projects, the accidents, and things that fly under the
radar.</p>
<p>I have it from Wilhite (30+ years ago) that the first DEC10 was delivered
to CompuServe by mistake. It was then the computing arm of Goden United
Life Insurnace Compay. They had ordered a smaller machine from Digital
Equiptment Corporation. When the DEC10 arrived, they kept it, eventually
started selling extra cycles as time-sharing (Cloud Computing, 1975),
built a packet switched network, c.a. 1972 (take that ARPANet), started
the first online service, c.a. 1979, and much of the world as we know
it today was born.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Dan Piskur had to invent &ldquo;Cybersecurity&rdquo; <em>ab initio</em>.</p>
<p>Wilhite left Ohio State during the 1970 riots to go do fun work on a
big computer at a startup down the road.  He never finished his
degree. Too much to do.  Things worked out.  I think I can say the
same.</p>
<p>People matter. Individuals matter.  Side projects matter (again,
see <a href="http://curious.galthub.com/blog/steve/">Wilhite and GIF</a>.).</p>
<p>So make your strategic plans, track things in your kan-ban boards, have
project managers run your agile sprints, but remember</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Life is what happens to you while you&rsquo;re busy making other plans&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; John Lennon, 1980 in &ldquo;Beautiful Boy&rdquo;</p>
