I've had my eye\non a few for a while ([The Camino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago), [Kungsleden](https://www.swedishtouristassociation.com/areas/kungsleden/), [Dolly Sods](https://www.fs.usda.gov/r09/monongahela/recreation/dolly-sods-wilderness),\netc.) and may now have the freedom, time and health to explore some of them (knock on wood).\n\nFor now at least I have some space to decompress a little and\nallow some disorder to creep in to my gear and my life.\n\n\n",

It started when I wanted confirmation that my auto policy would cover me when renting a car, as I believed it had for the past 30 years. So I called my agent three times and never got a straight answer. Frustrated, I called a friend who is an agent at another insurance company. She answered my question in one minute.</p>\n<p>I also had a question about my homeowners policy. At this point I was loath to call my agent again since I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d believe any answer I received. The former owner of the agency had recently retired; she used to stay on the phone until 9 PM to ensure questions were answered. Another call resulted in someone saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that; I&rsquo;ll have to transfer you to an agent.&rdquo; After holding for 10 minutes, I was told, &ldquo;Nobody is available; can they call you back?&rdquo; Begrudgingly, I agreed, but nobody called back. I called again hours later, only to find out they had spoken to my wife about a different matter but had not returned my call.</p>\n<p>From here, I planned to transfer my policy to a different agency with the same insurer. The idea was to call them in a sales situation to see if a) they’d answer the phone, and b) they could answer my coverage question. But after three calls and only reaching a voicemail to &ldquo;leave a number&rdquo;.  So much for that plan.</p>\n<p>Plan C: I decided to use ChatGPT. After downloading my policy, I discovered the PDF was encoded to prevent easy text extraction. After researching PDF to text OCR solutions and getting one to work on my laptop, I finally uploaded my policy text to ChatGPT. In about 30 seconds, I got an answer straight from my policy.</p>\n<p>I then compared the full text of my old policy with a potential new one using ChatGPT, resulting in a clear side-by-side comparison. Very Nice.</p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m not going to seek answers from people at my old agency who appear to lack the knowledge and dedication of the previous owner. Nor will I transfer to an agency that won&rsquo;t answer a sales call. I’ll switch to the company where my friend works, as they answer calls, seem knowledgeable, and offered me a lower rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Implications for AI:</strong></p>\n<p>It means I can get answers without talking to people who may not know what they are\ntalking about (or who just won&rsquo;t give me the time of day). It means I can get my\nown answers quickly from the authoritative source using AI directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Caveat quaesitor</strong></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>&ldquo;Trust but verify&rdquo;</dt>\n<dd>Answers from AI need to be validated.  They very often get you &ldquo;in the ball-park&rdquo;, but you need to look at the results and apply common-sense tests, and to the extent that you have expertise (as I do with programming), see if the answers are silly or wrong.</dd>\n<dt>I&rsquo;m not your average AI user</dt>\n<dd>I have a degree in Computer Science, have been toying around the edges of AI and cognitive science since the 80s and worked some with &ldquo;modern&rdquo; AI and data science the last few years of my career.  But I think the beauty of LLMs is that you don&rsquo;t need my level of understanding to use them.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><strong>Impact on Jobs:</strong></p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have to take Teslas to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes.</p>\n<p>People can do more productive things with their time. I suppose we could have government\nregulations and subsidies for blacksmiths and unions protecting their jobs. People\nshouldn&rsquo;t have to work in dead-end jobs.</p>\n<p>When the camera was invented, I&rsquo;m sure there was push-back form portrait painters, but painters moved on to things the camera could not do: impressionist and abstract art, etc. I&rsquo;m glad we got Monet, Picasso, etc. When the printing press was invented we got mass literacy because we were no longer dependent on sciptoria full of monks hand-copying every manuscript. There will be disruption, but the world and people&rsquo;s lives will be better in the end.</p>\n<p>Let’s move on to bigger and better things.  Together.</p>",

I called again hours later, only to find out they had spoken to my wife about a different matter but had not returned my call.\n\nFrom here, I planned to transfer my policy to a different agency with the same insurer. The idea was to call them in a sales situation to see if a) they’d answer the phone, and b) they could answer my coverage question. But after three calls and only reaching a voicemail to \"leave a number\".  So much for that plan.\n\nPlan C: I decided to use ChatGPT. After downloading my policy, I discovered the PDF was encoded to prevent easy text extraction. After researching PDF to text OCR solutions and getting one to work on my laptop, I finally uploaded my policy text to ChatGPT. In about 30 seconds, I got an answer straight from my policy.\n\nI then compared the full text of my old policy with a potential new one using ChatGPT, resulting in a clear side-by-side comparison. Very Nice.\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nI’m not going to seek answers from people at my old agency who appear to lack the knowledge and dedication of the previous owner. Nor will I transfer to an agency that won't answer a sales call. I’ll switch to the company where my friend works, as they answer calls, seem knowledgeable, and offered me a lower rate.\n\n**Implications for AI:**\n\nIt means I can get answers without talking to people who may not know what they are\ntalking about (or who just won't give me the time of day). It means I can get my\nown answers quickly from the authoritative source using AI directly.\n\n**Caveat quaesitor**\n\n\"Trust but verify\"\n: Answers from AI need to be validated.  They very often get you \"in the ball-park\", but you need to look at the results and apply common-sense tests, and to the extent that you have expertise (as I do with programming), see if the answers are silly or wrong.\n\n\nI'm not your average AI user\n: I have a degree in Computer Science, have been toying around the edges of AI and cognitive science since the 80s and worked some with \"modern\" AI and data science the last few years of my career.  But I think the beauty of LLMs is that you don't need my level of understanding to use them.\n\n**Impact on Jobs:**\n\nWe don't have to take Teslas to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes.\n\nPeople can do more productive things with their time. I suppose we could have government\nregulations and subsidies for blacksmiths and unions protecting their jobs. People\nshouldn't have to work in dead-end jobs.\n\nWhen the camera was invented, I'm sure there was push-back form portrait painters, but painters moved on to things the camera could not do: impressionist and abstract art, etc. I'm glad we got Monet, Picasso, etc. When the printing press was invented we got mass literacy because we were no longer dependent on sciptoria full of monks hand-copying every manuscript. There will be disruption, but the world and people's lives will be better in the end.\n\nLet’s move on to bigger and better things.  Together.\n",

Saturday was bueatiful spring day and the constant stream of hikers\nmade it clear why this popular section needed to be improved: the heavy\ntraffic has taken it&rsquo;s toll over the years exposing rock and roots. The trail\nkeeps shifing downhill off it&rsquo;s original location because\nhikers invariably walk downhill to avoid rocks, widening it as they do so.</p>\n<p>Friday night we arived at Bears Den where host Glenn welcomed the crew,\nproviding beds and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.</p>\n<p>Saturday began with a short drive to the work site.   We accessed\nthe work site from private property (with permission) near the work site.\nDistrict managers Chris Brnuton and Rob Lamar had flagged\nan ad-hoc trail up to the work site. Nobody wants to carry\nheavy tools through the roller-coaster!</p>\n<p>Robert Fina arrived with his truck-o-tools which were distributed.\nWe had a &ldquo;safety circle&rdquo; talk where everyone contributed one\nsaftey tip.</p>\n<p>The work site was about 0.9 miles north of Snickers Gap. The focus\nwas on removing rocks, moving the trail back uphill and improving the\ntread. This involved digging two large pits to extract mineral soil,\ndigging out some rocks, using a grip hoist to pull larger rocks\nout of the ground and off the trail, removing organic soil and rebuilding\nthe surface with smaller rocks (large gravel) and mineral soil.</p>\n<p>Near the end of the project, we were able to observe the results:\nhikers were following the new, smoother path we had created and\nnot walking off trail for better footing.</p>\n<p>Back at Bears Den we cleaned up, had a &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; and\na fine potluck dinner.  Songs were sung.  Card games were played\n(&ldquo;Up And Down The River&rdquo; is apparently a Cadillac Crew favorite).\nAgressive relaxation was done</p>\n<p>SUNDAY WORK FOCUSED ON …</p>\n<p>A fun time was had by most,  at least after a little Ibuprpophen and a shower.\nFirst timers included X,X and X.

Small rocks can be levered out with a pick or rock bars, but that technique is slow and labor intensive for larger and mostly buried rocks. For these, we developed a process using a grip hoist to pull the rocks free from the soil. Since getting a chain around a buried rock is difficult, first we use a gas power rock drill to make a hole in the rock on the opposite side of the rock from the grip hoist. Then a steel rod is inserted into the hole. The grip hoist cable is attached to the bar with a short length of chain. Cranking on the grip hoist gradually, and easily, pulls the rock out of the ground. Once it is lifted out of the ground a bit,  crew members crib it up by tossing smaller rocks beneath. If necessary, a chain can be looped around the rock to pull it out the rest of the way, and into its final location off the trail. With an experienced crew of 3 or 4, we can remove a big rock every 10 to 15 minutes.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h1 id=\"january-2025-article\">January 2025 Article</h1>\n<p>[see next pg for pics]</p>\n<p>A cold and icy start to the Cadillac Crew’s season\nBy Karen Brown, Eddie Becton, Martha Becton et. al.</p>\n<p>What does a trail crew do when the thermometer dips below freezing and the ground is covered with ice and snow?</p>\n<p>Well, they build trails!</p>\n<p>Though morning temps hovered around 10 degrees, the Cadillac Crew started our January weekend snug in the lovingly-restored Mountain Home Bed &amp; Breakfast of Front Royal, lucky guests of owners Lisa and Scott.</p>\n<p>Mountain Home’s listings on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places made the Crew’s weekend an exceptional treat with its mid-1800s architecture and Greek Revival details.  While the front part of the Main House was built in 1847, part of the foundation dates back to the 1780s.  Mountain Home’s rich history can be explored as a guest or through the B&amp;B’s website.</p>\n<p>After a hearty breakfast we were off to Tuckers Lane parking lot and AT trailhead to work on a beautiful section recommended by District Managers Jon Rindt and Maston Gray.  Jon and section maintainer George Jones joined us for the day as welcomed additions. The trail had been scouted by crew leader, Dan Feer, and George Jones and Tysha Robinson who spotted decaying steps and lots of washed-out tread —our specialty!</p>\n<p>Equipped with hand warmers and microspikes to combat the cold and icy trail, crew members Eddie Becton, Martha Becton, Karen Brown, Maria de la Torre, Alice DeCarlo, Kirsten Elowsky, Dan Feer, Ellen Feer, Robert Fina, George Jones, Jonathan Kauffman, James Martin, Don Oellerich, Cat Randall, Jon Rindt, Tysha Robinson, Alisa Schaefer, Ellen Shaw, Dan Wooley, and Mark Wrobel broke into small groups. Some worked on rolling grade dips to improve tread drainage and trail maintainability.  To boost hiker safety, others replaced log stairs and the rest on a very short section of new trail around dangerous log stairs.</p>\n<p>The first task for all of us was simply getting to the ground below the ice and snow. Ellen Feer spent hours at the trailhead clearing the hazardous ice covering the bridge and stone steps while the rest of us got to work digging through the ice and snow on the trial. Even this much exertion couldn’t keep our toes from getting cold, so imagine how we welcomed the hot chocolate and marshmallows Kirsten provided at lunchtime!</p>\n<p>The low afternoon sun cast long shadows on freshly-finished rolling grade dips, scattered saw dust from removed dead trees and cut logs, newly-built wooden steps, and finishing touches on the bypass. Gratefully we carpooled back to hot baths, happy hour, a delicious dinner and toasty beds.</p>\n<p>Sunday was a little warmer, so we tackled a few more erosion issues. More rolling grade dips coming up! A steep section needed steps, but appropriate rocks were not to be found. Robert, C sawyer and Karen, swamper selected a standing dead locust tree along the trail with good wood for steps. Before felling it, Robert squared the sides, cut notches for pegs and cut it to length. Once down, the pegs were cut from the stump to secure the step. The Crew installed the stairs with amazing results.</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful winter weekend to welcome new member Maria, appreciate second-timers James and Jonathan and reconnect with old friends.

All I was told was to wear clothing that I didn&rsquo;t mind getting dirty.  This advice was given, for the record, by a crew member who worked in a nice Patagonia sweater.  I spent much of the day &ldquo;mining&rdquo; next to the base of a fallen tree as I quickly learned that buckets of non-organic dirt are a critical component in trail maintenance.  I kept saying that &ldquo;mining&rdquo; is a fancy word for &ldquo;digging a hole&rdquo; but it did allow me to dream of mining for gold.  Although no gold was discovered, the many nice comments from passing hikers did make the whole experience worthwhile.  It is an amazing and dedicated crew and I look forward to joining future outings.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>A fun time was had by all, after a little ibuprofen and a hot shower!

This tone aligns well with the overall atmosphere of the weekend, contributing to a more enjoyable reading experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, Greg Wilson’s quote enriches the article by providing insight into the volunteer experience, enhancing the community narrative, and inviting more participants to join in future activities.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-where-its-placed-in-the-story\">What about where it&rsquo;s placed in the story?</h2>\n<p>The placement of Greg Wilson&rsquo;s quote in the story is effective for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>After the Work Description</strong>: The quote appears after the technical descriptions of the work done and the observable improvements made to the trail. This positioning provides a natural segue to personal experiences, allowing the technical details to establish the context before introducing individual reflections. It helps to contrast the rigorous work descriptions with a personal narrative, making the article well-rounded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encapsulation of Experience</strong>: By placing the quote after the description of the Saturday work activities and before transitioning to broader conclusions, it encapsulates the overall experience. It serves as a reflection on what first-time participants encounter, effectively summarizing the day’s events while adding a personal touch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Building Engagement</strong>: The quote invites readers to connect emotionally with the article. Its strategic placement after a detailed account of the work allows readers to appreciate the effort involved, then immediately see the rewarding impact of those efforts through Greg’s eyes.

Small rocks can be levered out with a pick or rock bars, but that technique is slow and labor intensive for larger and mostly buried rocks. For these, we developed a process using a grip hoist to pull the rocks free from the soil. Since getting a chain around a buried rock is difficult, first we use a gas power rock drill to make a hole in the rock on the opposite side of the rock from the grip hoist. Then a steel rod is inserted into the hole. The grip hoist cable is attached to the bar with a short length of chain. Cranking on the grip hoist gradually, and easily, pulls the rock out of the ground. Once it is lifted out of the ground a bit,  crew members crib it up by tossing smaller rocks beneath. If necessary, a chain can be looped around the rock to pull it out the rest of the way, and into its final location off the trail. With an experienced crew of 3 or 4, we can remove a big rock every 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\n<a id=\"org546bb0c\"></a>\n\n# January 2025 Article\n\n[see next pg for pics]\n\nA cold and icy start to the Cadillac Crew’s season\nBy Karen Brown, Eddie Becton, Martha Becton et. al.\n\nWhat does a trail crew do when the thermometer dips below freezing and the ground is covered with ice and snow?\n\nWell, they build trails!\n\nThough morning temps hovered around 10 degrees, the Cadillac Crew started our January weekend snug in the lovingly-restored Mountain Home Bed & Breakfast of Front Royal, lucky guests of owners Lisa and Scott.  \n\nMountain Home’s listings on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places made the Crew’s weekend an exceptional treat with its mid-1800s architecture and Greek Revival details.  While the front part of the Main House was built in 1847, part of the foundation dates back to the 1780s.  Mountain Home’s rich history can be explored as a guest or through the B&B’s website. \n\nAfter a hearty breakfast we were off to Tuckers Lane parking lot and AT trailhead to work on a beautiful section recommended by District Managers Jon Rindt and Maston Gray.  Jon and section maintainer George Jones joined us for the day as welcomed additions. The trail had been scouted by crew leader, Dan Feer, and George Jones and Tysha Robinson who spotted decaying steps and lots of washed-out tread —our specialty!\n\nEquipped with hand warmers and microspikes to combat the cold and icy trail, crew members Eddie Becton, Martha Becton, Karen Brown, Maria de la Torre, Alice DeCarlo, Kirsten Elowsky, Dan Feer, Ellen Feer, Robert Fina, George Jones, Jonathan Kauffman, James Martin, Don Oellerich, Cat Randall, Jon Rindt, Tysha Robinson, Alisa Schaefer, Ellen Shaw, Dan Wooley, and Mark Wrobel broke into small groups. Some worked on rolling grade dips to improve tread drainage and trail maintainability.  To boost hiker safety, others replaced log stairs and the rest on a very short section of new trail around dangerous log stairs.  \n\nThe first task for all of us was simply getting to the ground below the ice and snow. Ellen Feer spent hours at the trailhead clearing the hazardous ice covering the bridge and stone steps while the rest of us got to work digging through the ice and snow on the trial. Even this much exertion couldn’t keep our toes from getting cold, so imagine how we welcomed the hot chocolate and marshmallows Kirsten provided at lunchtime! \n\nThe low afternoon sun cast long shadows on freshly-finished rolling grade dips, scattered saw dust from removed dead trees and cut logs, newly-built wooden steps, and finishing touches on the bypass. Gratefully we carpooled back to hot baths, happy hour, a delicious dinner and toasty beds.\n\nSunday was a little warmer, so we tackled a few more erosion issues. More rolling grade dips coming up! A steep section needed steps, but appropriate rocks were not to be found. Robert, C sawyer and Karen, swamper selected a standing dead locust tree along the trail with good wood for steps. Before felling it, Robert squared the sides, cut notches for pegs and cut it to length. Once down, the pegs were cut from the stump to secure the step. The Crew installed the stairs with amazing results.\n\nIt was a wonderful winter weekend to welcome new member Maria, appreciate second-timers James and Jonathan and reconnect with old friends.

All I was told was to wear clothing that I didn't mind getting dirty.  This advice was given, for the record, by a crew member who worked in a nice Patagonia sweater.  I spent much of the day \"mining\" next to the base of a fallen tree as I quickly learned that buckets of non-organic dirt are a critical component in trail maintenance.  I kept saying that \"mining\" is a fancy word for \"digging a hole\" but it did allow me to dream of mining for gold.  Although no gold was discovered, the many nice comments from passing hikers did make the whole experience worthwhile.  It is an amazing and dedicated crew and I look forward to joining future outings.'\n\nA fun time was had by all, after a little ibuprofen and a hot shower! First-timers included X, X, and X; second-timers included Y, Y, and Y. We’d love for you to join us next month!

I have a\n    handwritten notebook entitled \"Dr. Beecher's Lectures on Theology\"\n\n\n-   **The Underground Railroad:** My Great-great grandfather ran a stop on the underground railroad in\n    his barn about a days walk north of Marietta.\n    It was likely the 2nd stop northward for those \"illegal immigrants\"\n    heading for Canada after crossing the Ohio River (no small feat).\n    We have a 1920s newspaper article written by my great grandmother describing how they obstructed slave\n    catchers and gave them the run-around.\n\n\n-   **The Civil War:** My great grandfather was in an Ohio regiment of\n    Union army and saw action (and dug graves) at Vicksburg and other\n    locations.\n\n\nThe history connection has continued in recent and current generations:\n\n\n-   **Dad's Ohio Travels and the Ohio Historical Society:** My father spent 2 or\n    3 years as a photographer taking pictures of events around the\n    state for the \"Wonderful World of Ohio\" magazine, likely\n    following in many of Howe's footsteps 80+ years later. He then\n    spent 25 years working  at the Ohio Historical Society\n    microfilming newspapers from the 19th and 20th centuries,\n    preserving local history and genealogy, as well as some of the papers of President Harding.\n\n\n-   **My own travels:** Over the years I've visited many Ohio history\n    sites including [Serpent Mound](https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/browse-historical-sites/serpent-mound/), the Wright Brothers aviation sites in Dayton, the\n    Neil Armstrong (1st moon landing) museum, Geologic sites such a\n    glacial grooves and Flint ridge and the homes of presidents.  I witnessed baseball\n    history in person when Cincinnati native Pete Rose (d. 2024) got hit 4,192 to pass\n    Ty Cobb on the all-time hit list.\n\n\n-   **Teaching history today:** My son currently teaches history at a high school in Ohio.\n    A week or so ago, we visited the new [Great Council State Park](https://stateparks.com/great_council_state_park_in_ohio.html),\n    associated with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and Daniel Boone.\n\n\n\n\n<a id=\"org91157f3\"></a>\n\n\n## Where does this leave us?\n\n\nI'm glad I have some of the historical context around the state I grew\nup in and my family.  It reminds me that nobody's perfect and there\nare always challenges in life.\nI've never had to disobey the law to do what was right (hiding\nrun-away slaves).  I've never had to go to war.  I've never had to\nfloat down the Ohio river on a flatboat looking for a place to live\n(and, yes, there are other perspectives on all these stories.)\nI'm glad Dad spent his career preserving the stories\nof people all over the state microfilming newspapers.\nI hope my son is able to pass on the love for history that has come\ndown to me though the generations.\n\n\nWhat history connections do you have?  How do you benefit from what\nyou know?\n\n",

Here were some of the\nburning issues:\n\n\n-   Term limits\n-   The rule of law\n-   Favoritism and insider privilege\n-   Immigration\n-   \"Sanctuary Cities\"\n-   Assimilation of immigrants\n-   Citizenship\n-   Kingdom vs. Republic vs. Democracy\n-   Democracy requiring citizens prepared accept its responsibilities\n-   Shared power/checks and balances\n-   Roles for the masses, the aristocracy, and a strong executive\n-   Explicit classes based on wealth\n-   Enfranchisement and military responsibility based on class\n-   Hereditary privilege vs newcomers\n-   Hereditary privilege vs meritocracy\n-   Religion and State (\"Separation of\" was not a concept then)\n-   Morals and character as a foundation of good leadership\n-   A sense of destiny\n-   A need to explain a society/country's greatness\n-   A need to check the excesses of ambition\n-   A need to allow rewards for ambition and hard work\n-   Peruasive public speaking/campaign speeches\n-   Public posturing in legal cases\n-   Backroom politics/king-making\n-   A balance between military, civil and religious authority\n-   The family as the foundation of society\n-   Slavery\n-   The role of women\n-   Patriarchy\n\n\nThere are some fairly well-known stories in there as well: Romulus\nand Remus, Lucretia, and this guy named Brutus driving out a king,\nas his descendant/namesake would do ~500 years later with the murder\nof Julius Caesar. The republic ran another 3/400 years (down almost\nto Livy's day), the western empire ~500 years after that, and Byzantium\n(the eastern empire) down to the 1400s (just before Columbus).\nMore lessons to be learned there?  Probably (cf. Machiavelli).\n\n\nSo are there new issues?  Maybe.   Have we solved all the old ones?\nProbably not.  Can we ignore what's gone before?  Yes.   Will be\ndeluding ourselves and needlessly re-fighting old battles and\nre-inventing wheels if we do?\n\n\nThis is post #2/8 for [Blaugust 2024](https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/).

It has a little\nalcove in the wall just off the kitchen that was undoubtedly for \"the\nphone\". Growing up we had \"the kitchen phone\", and one on my dad's\ndesk. When it rang sometimes you had to dash to the other room to answer.\n\nPhones like the one pictured above could be thrown down the basement\nstairs onto a concrete floor and survive. Not that I would know. Bell\nENGINEERED their hardware.\n\nI'm glad we have moved beyond that technology, but it made the world\nmove for over a hundred years.\n\n{{< figure src=\"https://eludom.micro.blog/uploads/2024/tni.jpg\" caption=\"<span class=\\\"figure-number\\\">Figure 2: </span>\\\"The TNI about to be removed\\\" by George Jones is licensed under CC BY 2.0\" width=\"200px\" >}}\n\nRead \"[Exploding the Phone](https://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Phone-Phil-Lapsley/dp/0802122280)\" for an insightful and amusing history of\nthe phone system, phone phreaks, the rise of hacker culture, and how\nSteve Jobs and Woz got their start selling blue boxes in the Berkeley\ndorms so students could \"steal\" long distance calls (my father's\nroommate got around the high cost of long distance in the 50's by using\nham radio to \"phone home\").

Side projects matter (again,\nsee [Wilhite and GIF](http://curious.galthub.com/blog/steve/).).\n\nSo make your strategic plans, track things in your kan-ban boards, have\nproject managers run your agile sprints, but remember\n\n> \"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans\"\n>\n> --- John Lennon, 1980 in \"Beautiful Boy\"\n\n\\#52 of #100DaysToOffload take 3.1, <https://100daystooffload.com/>\n",
